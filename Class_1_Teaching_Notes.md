# Class 1: Chapter 1 & 2 - Teaching Notes
## Introduction to Managerial Accounting & Cost Classification

---

## 1. BIG PICTURE

### Purpose of This Lecture
This is the **foundation** of the entire RSM222 course. Everything that follows builds on these concepts:
- Understanding what managerial accounting is (vs. financial accounting)
- Learning how to classify costs in different ways
- Establishing the language and framework for all future topics

### Connection to Previous Lectures
This is the **first lecture** - no prerequisites, but it sets up:
- **Class 3-5:** Job Order Costing, Process Costing, ABC (all require cost classification)
- **Class 6:** Variable Costing (requires understanding fixed vs. variable costs)
- **Class 8:** Budgeting (requires understanding cost behavior)
- **All later classes:** Decision-making requires proper cost classification

### Why This Matters
**For Exams:**
- Cost classification questions appear on every exam
- You'll be asked to classify costs in multiple ways simultaneously
- Exam questions often test whether you understand the "why" behind classifications

**For Real-World Management:**
- Managers need to understand costs to make decisions
- Different decisions require different cost classifications
- Misclassifying costs leads to bad decisions (e.g., dropping profitable products)

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS BREAKDOWN

### Concept 1: Managerial Accounting vs. Financial Accounting

**What it is:**
- **Financial Accounting:** Reports to external users (investors, creditors, regulators)
- **Managerial Accounting:** Reports to internal users (managers, employees)

**Why it exists:**
- Different users need different information
- External users need standardized, historical, audited information
- Internal users need flexible, forward-looking, decision-relevant information

**What problem it solves:**
- Helps managers make decisions (pricing, production, investment)
- Provides timely, relevant information without waiting for formal reporting periods

**Plain Language:**
- Financial accounting = "How did we do?" (report card)
- Managerial accounting = "What should we do?" (GPS navigation)

**Formal Terminology:**
- **Financial Accounting:** GAAP-based, historical, objective, periodic reports
- **Managerial Accounting:** No GAAP required, future-oriented, subjective, continuous reports

**Key Differences Table:**
| Aspect | Financial Accounting | Managerial Accounting |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Users | External | Internal |
| Purpose | Report performance | Aid decision-making |
| Rules | GAAP required | No mandatory rules |
| Time Focus | Historical | Future-oriented |
| Scope | Entire organization | Segments, products, departments |
| Frequency | Periodic (quarterly/annual) | Continuous/as needed |

### Concept 2: Cost Classification by Function

**What it is:**
Costs are grouped by what they're used for in the business.

**Why it exists:**
Helps understand where money is being spent and which functions are most expensive.

**What problem it solves:**
- Performance evaluation (which department is efficient?)
- Cost control (where can we cut costs?)
- Pricing decisions (what does it cost to make this product?)

**Categories:**

1. **Manufacturing Costs (Product Costs)**
   - **Direct Materials:** Raw materials that become part of the finished product
     - Example: Wood for a table, fabric for a shirt
   - **Direct Labor:** Wages of workers who directly make the product
     - Example: Assembly line workers, machine operators
   - **Manufacturing Overhead:** All other manufacturing costs
     - Indirect materials (glue, screws, cleaning supplies)
     - Indirect labor (supervisors, maintenance workers)
     - Factory costs (rent, utilities, depreciation)

2. **Non-Manufacturing Costs (Period Costs)**
   - **Selling Costs:** Costs to get customers to buy
     - Example: Advertising, sales commissions, delivery costs
   - **Administrative Costs:** Costs to run the company
     - Example: Executive salaries, accounting, legal fees

**Plain Language:**
- Product costs = "What it costs to make stuff"
- Period costs = "What it costs to sell stuff and run the business"

**Memory Anchor:**
- Product costs "attach" to inventory (go on balance sheet until sold)
- Period costs "expense immediately" (go on income statement right away)

---

### Concept 3: Cost Classification by Behavior

**What it is:**
How costs change when activity level (volume) changes.

**Why it exists:**
Critical for:
- Budgeting (predicting costs at different activity levels)
- Decision-making (should we increase production?)
- Break-even analysis
- Variable costing (Class 6)

**What problem it solves:**
- Helps predict total costs at different production levels
- Enables "what-if" analysis
- Essential for pricing and profit planning

**Categories:**

1. **Variable Costs**
   - **Definition:** Total cost changes proportionally with activity level
   - **Per-unit:** Stays constant
   - **Total:** Increases as activity increases
   - **Example:** Direct materials ($5 per unit → 100 units = $500, 200 units = $1,000)
   - **Key Insight:** "More activity = more total cost, but same cost per unit"

2. **Fixed Costs**
   - **Definition:** Total cost stays the same regardless of activity level
   - **Per-unit:** Decreases as activity increases (because you're spreading the same total cost over more units)
   - **Total:** Stays constant
   - **Example:** Factory rent ($10,000/month → same whether you make 100 or 1,000 units)
   - **Key Insight:** "More activity = same total cost, but lower cost per unit"

3. **Mixed Costs (Semi-Variable)**
   - **Definition:** Has both fixed and variable components
   - **Example:** Phone bill = $50 base + $0.10 per minute
   - **Formula:** Total Cost = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost per Unit × Activity Level)

4. **Step Costs**
   - **Definition:** Fixed within a range, then jumps to a new level
   - **Example:** Supervisor salary (1 supervisor for 0-50 workers, need 2nd supervisor at 51 workers)

**Plain Language:**
- Variable = "Pay as you go" (like gas for your car)
- Fixed = "Pay regardless" (like car insurance)
- Mixed = "Base fee + pay as you go" (like cell phone plan)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Variable:** Total cost "varies" with activity
- **Fixed:** Total cost is "fixed" (doesn't change)
- Think of variable costs as "per unit" and fixed costs as "lump sum"

---

### Concept 4: Cost Classification by Traceability

**What it is:**
Whether a cost can be easily traced to a specific cost object (product, department, customer).

**Why it exists:**
Helps assign costs accurately for:
- Product costing
- Department performance evaluation
- Customer profitability analysis

**What problem it solves:**
- Accurate product costing (essential for pricing)
- Fair performance evaluation
- Better decision-making about which products/customers to keep

**Categories:**

1. **Direct Costs**
   - **Definition:** Can be easily and conveniently traced to a cost object
   - **Example:** Direct materials, direct labor for a specific product
   - **Key:** "Easy to trace" = direct

2. **Indirect Costs**
   - **Definition:** Cannot be easily or conveniently traced to a cost object
   - **Example:** Manufacturing overhead, shared facilities
   - **Key:** "Hard to trace" = indirect (must be allocated)

**Plain Language:**
- Direct = "I can point to exactly what this cost is for"
- Indirect = "This cost benefits many things, hard to say exactly how much goes to each"

**Memory Anchor:**
- Direct = "Directly traceable" (like a receipt with one item)
- Indirect = "Indirectly allocated" (like splitting a restaurant bill)

**Important Note:**
- Direct/Indirect depends on the **cost object**
- Example: Factory supervisor salary
  - Cost object = Product → **Indirect** (supervisor oversees many products)
  - Cost object = Factory → **Direct** (supervisor works directly for the factory)

---

### Concept 5: Cost Classification by Relevance to Decisions

**What it is:**
Whether a cost matters for a specific decision.

**Why it exists:**
Not all costs are relevant for every decision. Including irrelevant costs leads to bad decisions.

**What problem it solves:**
- Focuses attention on costs that actually matter
- Prevents "analysis paralysis"
- Leads to better decisions

**Categories:**

1. **Relevant Costs**
   - **Definition:** Costs that differ between alternatives
   - **Key Question:** "Will this cost change if I choose a different option?"
   - **Example:** When deciding to make or buy a component, the cost of materials is relevant (only incurred if we make it)

2. **Irrelevant Costs**
   - **Definition:** Costs that are the same regardless of which alternative is chosen
   - **Key Question:** "Is this cost the same for all options?"
   - **Example:** When deciding to make or buy, existing factory rent is irrelevant (we pay it either way)

**Special Cases:**

- **Sunk Costs:** Costs already incurred and cannot be changed
  - **Always irrelevant** for future decisions
  - **Example:** Money already spent on research - can't get it back, so ignore it when deciding whether to continue the project
  - **Common Mistake:** "We've already invested $1M, we can't quit now" ← Wrong! Sunk cost fallacy

- **Opportunity Costs:** The benefit given up by choosing one alternative over another
  - **Always relevant** (but often hidden/not in accounting records)
  - **Example:** Using factory space for Product A means giving up the ability to use it for Product B

**Plain Language:**
- Relevant = "This cost matters for my decision"
- Irrelevant = "This cost doesn't matter - it's the same either way"
- Sunk = "Money already spent - can't change it, so ignore it"
- Opportunity = "What I'm giving up by choosing this option"

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Relevant:** "Will it change?" → Yes = Relevant
- **Sunk:** "Can I change it?" → No = Sunk = Irrelevant
- **Opportunity:** "What am I missing out on?"

## 3. WALK THROUGH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Classifying a Single Cost Multiple Ways

**Scenario:** A company manufactures tables. Consider the cost of wood used to make a table.

**Question:** Classify this cost in all applicable ways.

**Thinking Process:**

1. **By Function:**
   - Wood becomes part of the finished table → **Direct Material**
   - This is a **Product Cost** (manufacturing cost)
   - Not a period cost (selling or administrative)

2. **By Behavior:**
   - If we make 10 tables, we need 10× the wood
   - If we make 100 tables, we need 100× the wood
   - Total cost increases proportionally with production → **Variable Cost**
   - Per-unit cost stays constant ($X per table)

3. **By Traceability:**
   - Can we easily trace wood to a specific table? Yes! → **Direct Cost**
   - (Cost object = individual table)

4. **By Relevance (for a specific decision):**
   - Decision: "Should we make or buy tables?"
   - If we make: we incur wood cost
   - If we buy: we don't incur wood cost
   - Cost differs between alternatives → **Relevant Cost**

**Answer:**
- Function: Direct Material (Product Cost)
- Behavior: Variable Cost
- Traceability: Direct Cost
- Relevance: Relevant (for make-or-buy decision)

---

### Example 2: Factory Supervisor Salary

**Scenario:** A factory supervisor earns $60,000/year and oversees production of multiple products.

**Question:** Classify this cost.

**Thinking Process:**

1. **By Function:**
   - Supervisor works in manufacturing → **Manufacturing Overhead**
   - This is a **Product Cost** (part of manufacturing)
   - Not direct labor (supervisor doesn't directly make products)

2. **By Behavior:**
   - Supervisor gets paid $60,000 whether factory makes 1,000 or 10,000 units
   - Total cost stays the same → **Fixed Cost**
   - Per-unit cost decreases as production increases

3. **By Traceability:**
   - Cost object = Individual Product → **Indirect Cost**
     - Can't easily say "Product A used $X of supervisor time"
   - Cost object = Factory → **Direct Cost**
     - Supervisor works directly for the factory

4. **By Relevance:**
   - Decision: "Should we close the factory?"
   - If we close: we don't pay supervisor
   - If we keep open: we pay supervisor
   - Cost differs → **Relevant Cost**

**Key Insight:** Same cost can be direct or indirect depending on the cost object!

## 4. COMMON CONFUSIONS & MISTAKES

### Confusion 1: Direct vs. Variable
**The Mistake:** Thinking "direct = variable" and "indirect = fixed"

**The Reality:** These are **independent classifications**
- Direct costs can be variable (direct materials) OR fixed (direct supervisor for one product)
- Indirect costs can be variable (indirect materials) OR fixed (factory rent)

**Example to Remember:**
- Direct materials = Direct AND Variable
- Factory rent = Indirect AND Fixed
- But: A direct cost (like a product-specific machine lease) can be Fixed
- And: An indirect cost (like electricity) can be Variable

**Memory Anchor:** Direct/Indirect = "Can I trace it?" | Variable/Fixed = "Does it change with volume?"

---

### Confusion 2: Product Costs vs. Period Costs - When They Hit the Income Statement
**The Mistake:** Thinking product costs never appear on the income statement

**The Reality:**
- Product costs go on the **balance sheet** first (as inventory)
- When the product is **sold**, product costs move to the income statement as "Cost of Goods Sold"
- Period costs go directly to the income statement in the period incurred

**Timeline Example:**
- January: Make 100 units, $5 product cost each = $500 in inventory (balance sheet)
- February: Sell 80 units → $400 goes to Cost of Goods Sold (income statement)
- Remaining 20 units still in inventory = $100 on balance sheet

**Memory Anchor:** Product costs "wait" in inventory until sold; period costs "expense immediately"

---

### Confusion 3: Fixed Costs Per Unit
**The Mistake:** "Fixed costs are always $X per unit"

**The Reality:** 
- **Total** fixed costs stay the same
- **Per-unit** fixed costs change with volume
- Example: $10,000 rent
  - 1,000 units → $10 per unit
  - 2,000 units → $5 per unit
  - 10,000 units → $1 per unit

**Why This Matters:** 
- Don't say "fixed costs are $10 per unit" without specifying the volume level
- Fixed costs per unit decrease as production increases (economies of scale)

---

### Confusion 4: Sunk Costs in Decision-Making
**The Mistake:** Including sunk costs in future decisions

**The Reality:**
- Sunk costs are **always irrelevant** for future decisions
- Common trap: "We've already spent $1M on this project, we can't quit"
- Correct thinking: "What are the future costs/benefits?" (ignore the $1M already spent)

**Example:**
- Spent $500K developing a product
- Need another $200K to launch
- Expected profit: $150K
- **Wrong Decision:** "We've spent $500K, we must launch" (total loss = $550K)
- **Right Decision:** "Future: spend $200K to make $150K = lose $50K, so don't launch" (total loss = $500K, which is sunk)

**Memory Anchor:** Sunk costs = "Water under the bridge" - can't change them, so ignore them

---

### Confusion 5: Direct Materials vs. Indirect Materials
**The Mistake:** Thinking all materials are direct

**The Reality:**
- **Direct Materials:** Become part of the finished product (wood in a table)
- **Indirect Materials:** Used in production but don't become part of the product (glue, screws, cleaning supplies)

**Rule of Thumb:**
- If you can see it in the final product → Direct Material
- If it's used but not visible → Indirect Material (part of overhead)

## 6. MEMORY ANCHORS

### Anchor 1: The Four Classification Systems
**Mnemonic:** "F-B-T-R" (Function-Behavior-Traceability-Relevance)
- **F**unction: What is it used for? (Product vs. Period)
- **B**ehavior: How does it change? (Variable vs. Fixed)
- **T**raceability: Can I trace it? (Direct vs. Indirect)
- **R**elevance: Does it matter? (Relevant vs. Irrelevant)

---

### Anchor 2: Product Costs Flow
**Visual:** Inventory → COGS
- Product costs "sit" in inventory (balance sheet)
- When sold → become Cost of Goods Sold (income statement)
- Period costs → go straight to income statement

---

### Anchor 3: Variable vs. Fixed
**Simple Rule:**
- **Variable:** "More activity = more total cost" (but same per unit)
- **Fixed:** "More activity = same total cost" (but less per unit)

**Test Question:** "If I make 2× as many units, what happens?"
- Variable total cost → doubles
- Fixed total cost → stays same
- Variable per unit → stays same
- Fixed per unit → halves

---

### Anchor 4: Direct vs. Indirect
**Key Question:** "Can I easily point to what this cost is for?"
- Yes → Direct
- No → Indirect (must allocate)

**Remember:** Depends on cost object!
- Factory rent: Direct to factory, Indirect to product

---

### Anchor 5: Relevant Costs
**Decision Rule:** "Will this cost change if I choose a different option?"
- Yes → Relevant
- No → Irrelevant (including sunk costs)

**Sunk Cost Reminder:** "Can I change it?" → No = Ignore it

---

### Anchor 6: Managerial vs. Financial
**Simple Contrast:**
- **Financial:** "How did we do?" (report card, historical, external)
- **Managerial:** "What should we do?" (GPS, future, internal)

---
