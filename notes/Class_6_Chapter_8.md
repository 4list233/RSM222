# Class 6: Chapter 8 - Teaching Notes
## Variable Costing (Absorption vs. Variable Costing)

---

## 1. BIG PICTURE

### Purpose of This Lecture
This lecture covers **two different approaches to costing inventory and calculating net operating income:**
- **Absorption Costing:** Includes all manufacturing costs (fixed and variable) in product costs
- **Variable Costing:** Includes only variable manufacturing costs in product costs

This is a **critical distinction** that affects:
- How inventory is valued
- How net income is calculated
- How costs are presented on income statements
- Decision-making

### Connection to Previous Lectures
**Builds on Class 1:**
- Uses cost classification by behavior (variable vs. fixed)
- Applies product costs vs. period costs
- Foundation for understanding the difference

**Builds on Class 2:**
- Uses contribution margin concept
- Applies CVP analysis thinking

**Builds on Class 3 & 4:**
- Both job order and process costing can use absorption or variable costing
- This is about **how costs are classified**, not how they're accumulated

**Sets up for:**
- **Class 8 (Budgeting):** Uses variable costing concepts
- **All decision-making:** Variable costing provides better information for decisions
- Understanding income statement differences

### Why This Matters
**For Exams:**
- Absorption vs. Variable costing is **extremely common** on exams
- You'll calculate income under both methods
- Questions test understanding of when income differs
- **Very high probability exam topic**

**For Real-World Management:**
- Variable costing provides better information for decision-making
- Absorption costing is required for external reporting (GAAP)
- Understanding the difference is critical for managers
- Affects performance evaluation and decision-making

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS BREAKDOWN

### Concept 1: Absorption Costing

**What it is:**
A costing method that includes **all manufacturing costs** (both variable and fixed) in product costs. Also called "full costing."

**Why it exists:**
- Required by **GAAP** for external financial reporting
- Matches costs with revenues (all manufacturing costs become part of inventory)
- Traditional approach used in job order and process costing

**What problem it solves:**
- Meets external reporting requirements
- Provides inventory valuation for balance sheet
- Allocates all manufacturing costs to products

**Product Costs (Absorption):**
- Direct Materials
- Direct Labor
- **Variable Manufacturing Overhead**
- **Fixed Manufacturing Overhead** ← Key difference!

**Period Costs (Absorption):**
- Variable Selling & Administrative
- Fixed Selling & Administrative

**Plain Language:**
- "All manufacturing costs (including fixed overhead) become part of inventory"
- Fixed overhead is "absorbed" into product costs
- Like a sponge absorbing water - all costs get absorbed into inventory

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Absorption = All manufacturing costs in inventory**
- **Fixed overhead is a product cost**

---

### Concept 2: Variable Costing

**What it is:**
A costing method that includes **only variable manufacturing costs** in product costs. Fixed manufacturing overhead is treated as a period cost.

**Why it exists:**
- Provides better information for **internal decision-making**
- Separates variable and fixed costs clearly
- Shows contribution margin
- Not allowed for external reporting (GAAP)

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides clearer cost behavior information
- Better for CVP analysis
- More useful for short-term decision-making
- Shows contribution margin format

**Product Costs (Variable):**
- Direct Materials
- Direct Labor
- **Variable Manufacturing Overhead**
- **Fixed Manufacturing Overhead is NOT included** ← Key difference!

**Period Costs (Variable):**
- **Fixed Manufacturing Overhead** ← Treated as period cost!
- Variable Selling & Administrative
- Fixed Selling & Administrative

**Plain Language:**
- "Only variable manufacturing costs become part of inventory"
- Fixed overhead is expensed immediately (period cost)
- Like paying rent - it's a fixed cost, not part of product cost

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Variable = Only variable costs in inventory**
- **Fixed overhead is a period cost**

---

### Concept 3: Key Difference - Fixed Manufacturing Overhead

**What it is:**
The **critical difference** between absorption and variable costing is how fixed manufacturing overhead is treated.

**Why it matters:**
- This difference causes:
  - Different inventory valuations
  - Different net income calculations
  - Different income statement formats

**Treatment:**

**Absorption Costing:**
- Fixed MOH is a **product cost**
- Goes into inventory (Work in Process → Finished Goods)
- Expensed when product is sold (Cost of Goods Sold)
- If inventory increases, some fixed MOH stays in inventory

**Variable Costing:**
- Fixed MOH is a **period cost**
- Expensed immediately in the period incurred
- Never goes into inventory
- Always expensed, regardless of sales

**Plain Language:**
- **Absorption:** Fixed overhead "waits" in inventory until sold
- **Variable:** Fixed overhead is "expensed now" regardless of sales

**Example:**
- Fixed MOH = $100,000
- Produce 10,000 units, sell 8,000 units
- **Absorption:** $80,000 in COGS, $20,000 in inventory
- **Variable:** $100,000 expensed immediately (none in inventory)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Absorption:** Fixed MOH → Inventory → COGS (when sold)
- **Variable:** Fixed MOH → Expense (immediately)

---

### Concept 4: Income Statement Formats

**What it is:**
The two costing methods produce different income statement formats.

**Why it exists:**
- Different cost classifications lead to different presentations
- Variable costing shows contribution margin
- Absorption costing follows traditional format

**Absorption Costing Income Statement:**
```
Sales
- Cost of Goods Sold (includes fixed MOH)
= Gross Margin
- Selling & Administrative Expenses
= Net Operating Income
```

**Variable Costing Income Statement:**
```
Sales
- Variable Cost of Goods Sold (variable MOH only)
- Variable Selling & Administrative
= Contribution Margin
- Fixed Manufacturing Overhead
- Fixed Selling & Administrative
= Net Operating Income
```

**Key Differences:**
- Absorption: Shows Gross Margin
- Variable: Shows Contribution Margin
- Absorption: Fixed MOH in COGS
- Variable: Fixed MOH as separate line item

**Plain Language:**
- **Absorption:** Traditional format, fixed overhead hidden in COGS
- **Variable:** Contribution format, fixed overhead visible

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Absorption:** Sales - COGS = Gross Margin
- **Variable:** Sales - Variable Costs = Contribution Margin

---

### Concept 5: When Net Income Differs

**What it is:**
Net income under absorption and variable costing will be **different** when inventory levels change.

**Why it happens:**
- Fixed MOH treatment differs
- When inventory changes, fixed MOH flows differently
- Only fixed MOH causes the difference

**Rules:**

1. **Production = Sales (No Change in Inventory)**
   - **Net Income is the SAME** under both methods
   - All fixed MOH is expensed in both methods

2. **Production > Sales (Inventory Increases)**
   - **Absorption Income > Variable Income**
   - Some fixed MOH stays in inventory (not expensed) under absorption
   - All fixed MOH is expensed under variable

3. **Production < Sales (Inventory Decreases)**
   - **Variable Income > Absorption Income**
   - Absorption expenses fixed MOH from previous periods (from inventory)
   - Variable only expenses current period fixed MOH

**Formula:**
- **Difference in Net Income = Change in Inventory × Fixed MOH per Unit**
- If inventory increases: Absorption income higher by this amount
- If inventory decreases: Variable income higher by this amount

**Plain Language:**
- **No inventory change:** Same income
- **Inventory increases:** Absorption income higher (fixed MOH in inventory)
- **Inventory decreases:** Variable income higher (absorption expenses old fixed MOH)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Inventory up:** Absorption income > Variable income
- **Inventory down:** Variable income > Absorption income
- **No change:** Same income

### Concept 6: Advantages and Disadvantages

**What it is:**
Understanding when to use each method and their trade-offs.

**Why it exists:**
- Helps understand which method is better for different purposes
- Explains why companies use both methods

**Absorption Costing:**

**Advantages:**
- Required for external reporting (GAAP)
- Matches costs with revenues
- Required for tax reporting

**Disadvantages:**
- Can distort net income (income affected by inventory changes)
- Fixed costs appear as variable (in per-unit costs)
- Less useful for decision-making
- Can encourage overproduction (to increase income)

**Variable Costing:**

**Advantages:**
- Better for decision-making
- Clear separation of variable and fixed costs
- Shows contribution margin
- Net income not affected by inventory changes
- Prevents overproduction incentive

**Disadvantages:**
- Not allowed for external reporting (GAAP)
- Not allowed for tax reporting
- Fixed costs not matched with revenues

**Plain Language:**
- **Absorption:** Required by GAAP, but can be misleading
- **Variable:** Better for decisions, but not for external reporting

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Absorption:** External reporting, can distort income
- **Variable:** Internal decisions, clearer cost behavior

## 3. WALK THROUGH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Absorption vs. Variable Costing - Complete Problem

**Scenario:**
- Units produced: 10,000
- Units sold: 8,000
- Selling price: $20 per unit
- Variable manufacturing cost: $8 per unit
- Fixed manufacturing overhead: $50,000 total
- Variable selling & admin: $2 per unit sold
- Fixed selling & admin: $30,000

**Questions:**
1. Calculate net income under absorption costing
2. Calculate net income under variable costing
3. Explain the difference

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Absorption Costing**

**Calculate Unit Product Cost:**
- Variable manufacturing: $8
- Fixed MOH per unit: $50,000 ÷ 10,000 = $5
- **Unit Product Cost = $8 + $5 = $13**

**Income Statement (Absorption):**
```
Sales (8,000 × $20)                    $160,000
Cost of Goods Sold (8,000 × $13)       (104,000)
Gross Margin                             56,000
Selling & Admin:
  Variable (8,000 × $2)                (16,000)
  Fixed                                 (30,000)
Net Operating Income                    $10,000
```

**Step 2: Variable Costing**

**Calculate Unit Product Cost:**
- Variable manufacturing: $8
- Fixed MOH: Not included in product cost
- **Unit Product Cost = $8**

**Income Statement (Variable):**
```
Sales (8,000 × $20)                    $160,000
Variable Costs:
  Variable COGS (8,000 × $8)            (64,000)
  Variable S&A (8,000 × $2)            (16,000)
Contribution Margin                      80,000
Fixed Costs:
  Fixed MOH                             (50,000)
  Fixed S&A                             (30,000)
Net Operating Income                      $0
```

**Step 3: Difference**
- Absorption Income: $10,000
- Variable Income: $0
- **Difference: $10,000**

**Explanation:**
- Inventory increased by 2,000 units (10,000 produced - 8,000 sold)
- Fixed MOH per unit = $5
- Under absorption: 2,000 units × $5 = $10,000 fixed MOH in ending inventory (not expensed)
- Under variable: All $50,000 fixed MOH expensed
- **Difference = $10,000** (fixed MOH in inventory under absorption)

### Example 2: Multiple Periods - Inventory Changes

**Scenario - Year 1:**
- Produce: 12,000 units
- Sell: 10,000 units
- Fixed MOH: $60,000
- Variable cost: $6 per unit
- Selling price: $15 per unit

**Scenario - Year 2:**
- Produce: 8,000 units
- Sell: 10,000 units (sells 2,000 from Year 1 inventory)
- Fixed MOH: $60,000
- Variable cost: $6 per unit
- Selling price: $15 per unit

**Question:** Calculate income under both methods for both years.

**Solution:**

**Year 1:**

**Absorption:**
- Unit cost = $6 + ($60,000 ÷ 12,000) = $6 + $5 = $11
- Sales: 10,000 × $15 = $150,000
- COGS: 10,000 × $11 = $110,000
- **Net Income = $40,000** (assuming no S&A for simplicity)

**Variable:**
- Unit cost = $6
- Sales: 10,000 × $15 = $150,000
- Variable COGS: 10,000 × $6 = $60,000
- Contribution Margin = $90,000
- Fixed MOH = $60,000
- **Net Income = $30,000**

**Difference Year 1:** Absorption $10,000 higher (inventory increased 2,000 units × $5 = $10,000)

**Year 2:**

**Absorption:**
- Unit cost = $6 + ($60,000 ÷ 8,000) = $6 + $7.50 = $13.50
- Sales: 10,000 × $15 = $150,000
- COGS: (2,000 × $11 from Year 1) + (8,000 × $13.50) = $22,000 + $108,000 = $130,000
- **Net Income = $20,000**

**Variable:**
- Unit cost = $6
- Sales: 10,000 × $15 = $150,000
- Variable COGS: 10,000 × $6 = $60,000
- Contribution Margin = $90,000
- Fixed MOH = $60,000
- **Net Income = $30,000**

**Difference Year 2:** Variable $10,000 higher (inventory decreased 2,000 units × $5 = $10,000)

**Key Insight:** Over two years, total income is the same, but timing differs!

## 4. COMMON CONFUSIONS & MISTAKES

### Confusion 1: Fixed MOH Treatment
**The Mistake:** Forgetting that fixed MOH treatment is the only difference

**The Reality:**
- **Only fixed manufacturing overhead** is treated differently
- Variable costs, selling costs, admin costs are the same
- Everything else is identical

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Only fixed MOH differs**
- **Everything else is the same**

---

### Confusion 2: When Income Differs
**The Mistake:** Thinking income always differs

**The Reality:**
- Income is **the same** when production = sales (no inventory change)
- Income **differs** only when inventory changes
- Difference = Change in inventory × Fixed MOH per unit

**Memory Anchor:**
- **No inventory change = Same income**
- **Inventory change = Different income**

---

### Confusion 3: Which Income is Higher?
**The Mistake:** Forgetting which method gives higher income when

**The Reality:**
- **Inventory increases:** Absorption income > Variable income
- **Inventory decreases:** Variable income > Absorption income
- **No change:** Same income

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Inventory up:** Absorption higher (fixed MOH in inventory)
- **Inventory down:** Variable higher (absorption expenses old fixed MOH)

---

### Confusion 4: Unit Product Cost
**The Mistake:** Using same unit cost for both methods

**The Reality:**
- **Absorption:** Unit cost includes fixed MOH
- **Variable:** Unit cost excludes fixed MOH
- Must calculate separately!

**Example:**
- Variable cost: $10
- Fixed MOH: $50,000 ÷ 10,000 = $5 per unit
- **Absorption unit cost = $15**
- **Variable unit cost = $10**

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Absorption:** Variable + Fixed MOH per unit
- **Variable:** Variable only

---

### Confusion 5: Income Statement Format
**The Mistake:** Using wrong format for each method

**The Reality:**
- **Absorption:** Traditional format (Sales - COGS = Gross Margin)
- **Variable:** Contribution format (Sales - Variable Costs = Contribution Margin)
- Fixed MOH location differs

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Absorption:** Gross Margin format
- **Variable:** Contribution Margin format

---
