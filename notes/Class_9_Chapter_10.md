## 2. CORE CONCEPTS BREAKDOWN

### Concept 1: Standard Costs

**What it is:**
Predetermined costs that serve as benchmarks for measuring performance. Standards are set for:
- **Price standards:** What we expect to pay (materials price, labor rate)
- **Quantity standards:** What we expect to use (materials per unit, hours per unit)

**Why it exists:**
- Provides targets for performance
- Enables variance analysis
- Helps with planning and control

**What problem it solves:**
- Sets expectations
- Provides basis for comparison
- Enables performance measurement

**Components:**
- **Standard Price:** Expected price per unit of input
- **Standard Quantity:** Expected quantity of input per unit of output
- **Standard Cost:** Standard Price × Standard Quantity

**Plain Language:**
- "What we expect things to cost and how much we expect to use"
- Like a recipe: expected ingredients (quantity) and expected prices

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Standard = Expected/Budgeted**
- **Price × Quantity = Standard Cost**

---

### Concept 2: Variance Analysis

**What it is:**
The process of comparing actual costs to standard costs and analyzing the differences (variances).

**Why it exists:**
- Identifies where actual differs from expected
- Helps find problems
- Enables management by exception

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides early warning of problems
- Helps identify causes
- Enables corrective action

**Types of Variances:**
- **Favorable (F):** Actual < Standard (good - cost less than expected)
- **Unfavorable (U):** Actual > Standard (bad - cost more than expected)

**Key Insight:**
- Favorable doesn't always mean good (might indicate quality problems)
- Unfavorable doesn't always mean bad (might be due to higher quality)

**Plain Language:**
- "Did we do better or worse than expected?"
- Favorable = Better than expected (cost-wise)
- Unfavorable = Worse than expected (cost-wise)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Favorable = Actual < Standard (cost less)**
- **Unfavorable = Actual > Standard (cost more)**

---

### Concept 3: Direct Materials Variances

**What it is:**
Variances related to direct materials costs. Two components:
- **Price Variance:** Difference due to paying more/less than expected
- **Quantity Variance:** Difference due to using more/less than expected

**Why it exists:**
- Materials costs are significant
- Need to separate price vs. quantity effects
- Different causes require different actions

**What problem it solves:**
- Identifies if problem is price or quantity
- Helps find root causes
- Enables targeted corrective action

**Formulas:**

**Total Materials Variance:**
- Actual Cost - Standard Cost
- = (Actual Quantity × Actual Price) - (Standard Quantity × Standard Price)

**Materials Price Variance:**
- = Actual Quantity × (Actual Price - Standard Price)
- = AQ × (AP - SP)
- **Isolates price effect**

**Materials Quantity Variance:**
- = Standard Price × (Actual Quantity - Standard Quantity)
- = SP × (AQ - SQ)
- **Isolates quantity effect**

**Key Insight:**
- Price variance uses **actual quantity** (what we actually bought)
- Quantity variance uses **standard price** (expected price)
- Total Variance = Price Variance + Quantity Variance

**Plain Language:**
- Price Variance: "Did we pay more/less than expected?"
- Quantity Variance: "Did we use more/less than expected?"

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Price Variance = AQ × (AP - SP)**
- **Quantity Variance = SP × (AQ - SQ)**
- **Total = Price + Quantity**

---

### Concept 4: Direct Labor Variances

**What it is:**
Variances related to direct labor costs. Two components:
- **Rate Variance:** Difference due to paying more/less per hour
- **Efficiency Variance:** Difference due to using more/fewer hours

**Why it exists:**
- Labor costs are significant
- Need to separate rate vs. efficiency effects
- Different causes require different actions

**What problem it solves:**
- Identifies if problem is wage rate or efficiency
- Helps find root causes
- Enables targeted corrective action

**Formulas:**

**Total Labor Variance:**
- Actual Cost - Standard Cost
- = (Actual Hours × Actual Rate) - (Standard Hours × Standard Rate)

**Labor Rate Variance:**
- = Actual Hours × (Actual Rate - Standard Rate)
- = AH × (AR - SR)
- **Isolates rate effect**

**Labor Efficiency Variance:**
- = Standard Rate × (Actual Hours - Standard Hours)
- = SR × (AH - SH)
- **Isolates efficiency effect**

**Key Insight:**
- Rate variance uses **actual hours** (hours actually worked)
- Efficiency variance uses **standard rate** (expected rate)
- Total Variance = Rate Variance + Efficiency Variance

**Plain Language:**
- Rate Variance: "Did we pay more/less per hour than expected?"
- Efficiency Variance: "Did we use more/fewer hours than expected?"

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Rate Variance = AH × (AR - SR)**
- **Efficiency Variance = SR × (AH - SH)**
- **Total = Rate + Efficiency**

---

### Concept 5: Variable Manufacturing Overhead Variances

**What it is:**
Variances related to variable manufacturing overhead. Two components:
- **Spending Variance:** Difference due to paying more/less than expected
- **Efficiency Variance:** Difference due to using more/fewer hours (if overhead is based on hours)

**Why it exists:**
- Overhead is significant cost
- Need to separate spending vs. efficiency effects
- Different causes require different actions

**What problem it solves:**
- Identifies if problem is overhead spending or efficiency
- Helps find root causes
- Enables targeted corrective action

**Formulas:**

**Total Variable Overhead Variance:**
- Actual Variable Overhead - Applied Variable Overhead
- = Actual - (Standard Hours × Variable Overhead Rate)

**Variable Overhead Spending Variance:**
- = Actual Variable Overhead - (Actual Hours × Variable Overhead Rate)
- = Actual - (AH × VOHR)
- **Isolates spending effect**

**Variable Overhead Efficiency Variance:**
- = Variable Overhead Rate × (Actual Hours - Standard Hours)
- = VOHR × (AH - SH)
- **Isolates efficiency effect**

**Key Insight:**
- Spending variance uses **actual hours**
- Efficiency variance uses **standard rate**
- Same structure as labor variances

**Plain Language:**
- Spending Variance: "Did we spend more/less on overhead than expected?"
- Efficiency Variance: "Did we use more/fewer hours than expected?"

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Spending Variance = Actual - (AH × VOHR)**
- **Efficiency Variance = VOHR × (AH - SH)**
- **Total = Spending + Efficiency**

---

### Concept 6: Fixed Manufacturing Overhead Variances

**What it is:**
Variances related to fixed manufacturing overhead. Two components:
- **Budget Variance:** Difference between actual and budgeted fixed overhead
- **Volume Variance:** Difference due to production volume (under/overapplied overhead)

**Why it exists:**
- Fixed overhead is significant
- Need to separate spending vs. volume effects
- Volume variance shows capacity utilization

**What problem it solves:**
- Identifies if problem is spending or volume
- Shows capacity utilization
- Enables targeted corrective action

**Formulas:**

**Total Fixed Overhead Variance:**
- Actual Fixed Overhead - Applied Fixed Overhead
- = Actual - (Standard Hours × Fixed Overhead Rate)

**Fixed Overhead Budget Variance:**
- = Actual Fixed Overhead - Budgeted Fixed Overhead
- = Actual - Budgeted
- **Isolates spending effect**

**Fixed Overhead Volume Variance:**
- = Budgeted Fixed Overhead - Applied Fixed Overhead
- = Budgeted - (SH × FOHR)
- **Isolates volume effect**

**Key Insight:**
- Budget variance = Spending control
- Volume variance = Capacity utilization
- Unfavorable volume variance = Underapplied overhead (produced less than expected)

**Plain Language:**
- Budget Variance: "Did we spend more/less than budgeted?"
- Volume Variance: "Did we produce more/less than expected?"

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Budget Variance = Actual - Budgeted**
- **Volume Variance = Budgeted - Applied**

## 3. WALK THROUGH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Direct Materials Variances

**Scenario:**
- Standard: 2 pounds per unit @ $5 per pound = $10 per unit
- Actual: Produced 1,000 units, used 2,100 pounds @ $5.20 per pound
- Total actual cost: $10,920

**Questions:**
1. Calculate materials price variance
2. Calculate materials quantity variance
3. Calculate total materials variance
4. Interpret results

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Materials Price Variance**
- AQ = 2,100 pounds
- AP = $5.20
- SP = $5.00
- Price Variance = 2,100 × ($5.20 - $5.00) = 2,100 × $0.20 = **$420 Unfavorable**
- Paid $0.20 more per pound than expected

**Step 2: Materials Quantity Variance**
- SP = $5.00
- AQ = 2,100 pounds
- SQ = 1,000 units × 2 pounds = 2,000 pounds
- Quantity Variance = $5.00 × (2,100 - 2,000) = $5.00 × 100 = **$500 Unfavorable**
- Used 100 pounds more than expected

**Step 3: Total Materials Variance**
- Actual Cost = 2,100 × $5.20 = $10,920
- Standard Cost = 2,000 × $5.00 = $10,000
- Total Variance = $10,920 - $10,000 = **$920 Unfavorable**
- Check: $420 + $500 = $920 ✓

**Step 4: Interpretation**
- **Price Variance (U $420):** Paid more than expected - investigate supplier prices
- **Quantity Variance (U $500):** Used more than expected - investigate waste, quality issues
- **Total (U $920):** Overall, materials cost $920 more than expected

### Example 2: Direct Labor Variances

**Scenario:**
- Standard: 3 hours per unit @ $15 per hour = $45 per unit
- Actual: Produced 1,000 units, used 2,900 hours @ $15.50 per hour
- Total actual cost: $44,950

**Questions:**
1. Calculate labor rate variance
2. Calculate labor efficiency variance
3. Calculate total labor variance
4. Interpret results

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Labor Rate Variance**
- AH = 2,900 hours
- AR = $15.50
- SR = $15.00
- Rate Variance = 2,900 × ($15.50 - $15.00) = 2,900 × $0.50 = **$1,450 Unfavorable**
- Paid $0.50 more per hour than expected

**Step 2: Labor Efficiency Variance**
- SR = $15.00
- AH = 2,900 hours
- SH = 1,000 units × 3 hours = 3,000 hours
- Efficiency Variance = $15.00 × (2,900 - 3,000) = $15.00 × (-100) = **$1,500 Favorable**
- Used 100 hours less than expected (more efficient!)

**Step 3: Total Labor Variance**
- Actual Cost = 2,900 × $15.50 = $44,950
- Standard Cost = 3,000 × $15.00 = $45,000
- Total Variance = $44,950 - $45,000 = **$50 Favorable**
- Check: $1,450 U + $1,500 F = $50 F ✓

**Step 4: Interpretation**
- **Rate Variance (U $1,450):** Paid more than expected - investigate wage rates
- **Efficiency Variance (F $1,500):** More efficient than expected - good performance!
- **Total (F $50):** Overall, labor cost $50 less than expected (efficiency gain offset rate increase)

## 4. COMMON CONFUSIONS & MISTAKES

### Confusion 1: Which Quantity to Use
**The Mistake:** Using wrong quantity in variance formulas

**The Reality:**
- **Price Variance:** Uses **Actual Quantity** (what we actually bought/used)
- **Quantity Variance:** Uses **Standard Price** (expected price)
- **Rate Variance:** Uses **Actual Hours** (hours actually worked)
- **Efficiency Variance:** Uses **Standard Rate** (expected rate)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Price/Rate variances use ACTUAL quantity/hours**
- **Quantity/Efficiency variances use STANDARD price/rate**

---

### Confusion 2: Favorable vs. Unfavorable
**The Mistake:** Thinking favorable always means good

**The Reality:**
- **Favorable:** Actual < Standard (cost less)
- **Unfavorable:** Actual > Standard (cost more)
- But: Favorable might indicate quality problems (cheaper materials)
- And: Unfavorable might be acceptable (higher quality)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Favorable = Cost less (but check quality!)**
- **Unfavorable = Cost more (but might be worth it)**

---

### Confusion 3: Standard Quantity Calculation
**The Mistake:** Using wrong standard quantity

**The Reality:**
- Standard Quantity = **Units Produced** × Standard Quantity per Unit
- Not units sold! Use units produced for materials and labor variances

**Example:**
- Produced 1,000 units, sold 800 units
- Standard: 2 pounds per unit
- Standard Quantity = 1,000 × 2 = 2,000 pounds (not 800 × 2!)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Standard Quantity = Units PRODUCED × Standard per Unit**
- **Not units sold!**

---

### Confusion 4: Volume Variance Interpretation
**The Mistake:** Thinking volume variance is about spending

**The Reality:**
- Volume variance is about **capacity utilization**, not spending
- Unfavorable volume variance = Produced less than expected (underapplied overhead)
- Favorable volume variance = Produced more than expected (overapplied overhead)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Volume Variance = Capacity Utilization**
- **Not spending control**

---

### Confusion 5: Variance Sign Interpretation
**The Mistake:** Getting confused about what positive/negative means

**The Reality:**
- **Unfavorable:** Actual > Standard (cost more) - usually shown as positive number
- **Favorable:** Actual < Standard (cost less) - usually shown as negative number or with "F"
- Focus on the label (F/U), not just the sign

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Focus on Favorable/Unfavorable label**
- **Not just positive/negative**
