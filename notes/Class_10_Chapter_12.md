## 2. CORE CONCEPTS BREAKDOWN

### Concept 1: Relevant Costs

**What it is:**
Costs that **differ between alternatives** and will be incurred in the future. Only relevant costs should be considered in decisions.

**Why it exists:**
- Not all costs matter for every decision
- Including irrelevant costs leads to bad decisions
- Focuses attention on what actually matters

**What problem it solves:**
- Prevents "analysis paralysis"
- Focuses on costs that actually differ
- Leads to better decisions

**Characteristics of Relevant Costs:**
1. **Future costs** (not past/sunk costs)
2. **Differ between alternatives**
3. **Avoidable** (can be avoided by choosing one alternative)

**Characteristics of Irrelevant Costs:**
1. **Sunk costs** (already incurred, can't change)
2. **Same for all alternatives**
3. **Unavoidable** (will be incurred regardless)

**Plain Language:**
- Relevant = "Will this cost change if I choose differently?"
- If yes → Relevant
- If no → Irrelevant

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Relevant = Future + Different + Avoidable**
- **Irrelevant = Sunk + Same + Unavoidable**

---

### Concept 2: Sunk Costs

**What it is:**
Costs that have already been incurred and cannot be changed by any future decision.

**Why it matters:**
- **Always irrelevant** for future decisions
- Common mistake: Including sunk costs in decisions
- Leads to "sunk cost fallacy"

**What problem it solves:**
- Prevents bad decisions based on past investments
- Focuses on future costs and benefits
- Enables rational decision-making

**Examples:**
- Money already spent on research
- Depreciation on existing equipment
- Past advertising expenses
- Cost of equipment already purchased

**Plain Language:**
- "Money already spent - can't get it back, so ignore it"
- Like a movie ticket - if you've already paid, the cost shouldn't affect whether you stay or leave

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Sunk = Past = Irrelevant**
- **"Can I change it?" → No = Sunk = Ignore**

---

### Concept 3: Opportunity Costs

**What it is:**
The benefit given up by choosing one alternative over another. Often not recorded in accounting records but always relevant.

**Why it exists:**
- Resources have alternative uses
- Choosing one option means giving up others
- Must consider what we're missing out on

**What problem it solves:**
- Captures hidden costs
- Ensures all costs are considered
- Leads to better resource allocation

**Examples:**
- Using factory space for Product A means giving up Product B
- Using cash for investment means giving up interest
- Using employee time for project means giving up other work

**Plain Language:**
- "What am I missing out on by choosing this option?"
- Like choosing between two job offers - the one you don't take is the opportunity cost

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Opportunity Cost = "What I'm giving up"**
- **Always relevant, often hidden**

---

### Concept 4: Make-or-Buy Decision

**What it is:**
Decision whether to make a component internally or buy it from an external supplier.

**Why it exists:**
- Companies must decide how to source components
- Trade-off between internal production and external purchase
- Affects costs, quality, control

**What problem it solves:**
- Determines most cost-effective sourcing
- Considers all relevant factors
- Optimizes resource use

**Analysis Approach:**
1. **Identify relevant costs:**
   - **Make:** Variable costs + Any avoidable fixed costs
   - **Buy:** Purchase price
   - **Ignore:** Sunk costs, unavoidable fixed costs

2. **Compare alternatives:**
   - Total cost to make vs. total cost to buy
   - Choose lower cost option

3. **Consider qualitative factors:**
   - Quality control
   - Supplier reliability
   - Capacity utilization
   - Strategic considerations

**Plain Language:**
- "Should we make it ourselves or buy it?"
- Compare: Cost to make vs. Cost to buy
- Choose cheaper option (considering all relevant costs)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Make-or-Buy = Compare costs**
- **Only relevant costs matter**

---

### Concept 5: Special Order Decision

**What it is:**
Decision whether to accept a one-time order at a price below normal selling price.

**Why it exists:**
- Companies receive special pricing requests
- Need to decide if low price is acceptable
- Must consider capacity and other orders

**What problem it solves:**
- Determines if special order is profitable
- Uses excess capacity effectively
- Avoids accepting unprofitable orders

**Analysis Approach:**
1. **Identify relevant costs:**
   - **Relevant:** Variable costs of special order
   - **Irrelevant:** Fixed costs (if capacity available), sunk costs

2. **Compare:**
   - Special order price vs. Variable costs
   - If price > variable costs → Accept (contributes to fixed costs)
   - If price < variable costs → Reject (loses money)

3. **Consider constraints:**
   - Capacity available?
   - Will it affect regular sales?
   - Any opportunity costs?

**Key Rule:**
- **Accept if:** Special price > Variable costs (and no better alternatives)
- **Reject if:** Special price < Variable costs

**Plain Language:**
- "Should we take this one-time order at a low price?"
- If price covers variable costs and we have capacity → Accept
- If price doesn't cover variable costs → Reject

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Special Order = Price vs. Variable Costs**
- **Accept if price > variable costs**

---

### Concept 6: Product Mix Decision

**What it is:**
Decision about which products to produce and in what quantities when resources are limited.

**Why it exists:**
- Companies have limited resources (labor, materials, machine time)
- Must decide how to allocate resources
- Goal: Maximize profit given constraints

**What problem it solves:**
- Optimizes resource allocation
- Maximizes profitability
- Handles capacity constraints

**Analysis Approach:**
1. **Calculate contribution margin per unit** for each product
2. **Calculate contribution margin per constrained resource** (e.g., per machine hour)
3. **Rank products** by contribution margin per constrained resource
4. **Allocate resources** to highest-ranking products first

**Key Insight:**
- Don't just look at contribution margin per unit
- Look at contribution margin per **constrained resource**
- Product with highest CM per unit might not be best if it uses lots of constrained resource

**Plain Language:**
- "Which products should we make when we have limited resources?"
- Rank by contribution margin per hour (or other constraint)
- Make products with highest contribution per constraint first

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Product Mix = Contribution Margin per Constraint**
- **Rank and allocate to highest first**

---

### Concept 7: Keep or Drop Decision

**What it is:**
Decision whether to continue or discontinue a product line, segment, or division.

**Why it exists:**
- Some products/segments may be unprofitable
- Need to decide if they should be dropped
- Must consider all effects

**What problem it solves:**
- Identifies unprofitable segments
- Determines if dropping improves overall profit
- Considers all relevant factors

**Analysis Approach:**
1. **Calculate segment margin:**
   - Revenue - Variable Costs - Traceable Fixed Costs
   - If positive → Segment contributes to company
   - If negative → Segment loses money

2. **Consider:**
   - **Relevant:** Lost revenue, avoidable costs
   - **Irrelevant:** Allocated common fixed costs, sunk costs

3. **Compare:**
   - Keep: Current segment margin
   - Drop: Savings in avoidable costs - Lost revenue
   - Choose option with higher profit

**Key Insight:**
- Don't drop just because segment shows a loss
- Must consider if fixed costs are avoidable
- Common fixed costs allocated to segment are irrelevant

**Plain Language:**
- "Should we keep or drop this product line?"
- Compare: Profit if keep vs. Profit if drop
- Only consider avoidable costs and lost revenue

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Keep or Drop = Compare alternatives**
- **Only avoidable costs are relevant**

## 3. WALK THROUGH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Make-or-Buy Decision

**Scenario:**
Company currently makes a component internally:
- Direct materials: $5 per unit
- Direct labor: $3 per unit
- Variable overhead: $2 per unit
- Fixed overhead: $50,000 total (of which $30,000 is avoidable if we buy)
- Production: 10,000 units per year

External supplier offers to supply for $11 per unit.

**Question:** Should we make or buy?

**Solution:**

**Cost to Make:**
- Variable costs: ($5 + $3 + $2) × 10,000 = $100,000
- Avoidable fixed costs: $30,000
- **Total Relevant Cost to Make = $130,000**

**Cost to Buy:**
- Purchase price: $11 × 10,000 = **$110,000**

**Comparison:**
- Make: $130,000
- Buy: $110,000
- **Difference: $20,000 savings if we buy**

**Decision:** **Buy** - saves $20,000 per year

**Note:** Ignore the $20,000 unavoidable fixed overhead - it's the same whether we make or buy, so irrelevant.

---

### Example 2: Special Order Decision

**Scenario:**
- Normal selling price: $20 per unit
- Variable costs: $12 per unit
- Fixed costs: $100,000 total
- Normal production: 10,000 units
- Capacity: 12,000 units

Customer offers to buy 2,000 units at $15 per unit (one-time order).

**Question:** Should we accept the special order?

**Solution:**

**Relevant Costs:**
- Special order price: $15 per unit
- Variable costs: $12 per unit
- **Contribution margin: $3 per unit**

**Analysis:**
- We have capacity (10,000 + 2,000 = 12,000 ≤ 12,000 capacity)
- Special price ($15) > Variable costs ($12)
- Contribution margin = $3 per unit × 2,000 = $6,000
- Fixed costs are irrelevant (same regardless)

**Decision:** **Accept** - adds $6,000 to profit

**Note:** Even though $15 < normal price $20, we should accept because:
- We have excess capacity
- Price covers variable costs
- Contributes $6,000 to fixed costs and profit

### Example 3: Product Mix Decision

**Scenario:**
Company makes two products with limited machine hours (1,000 hours available):

**Product A:**
- Contribution margin: $50 per unit
- Machine hours: 2 hours per unit
- Demand: 300 units

**Product B:**
- Contribution margin: $40 per unit
- Machine hours: 1 hour per unit
- Demand: 500 units

**Question:** What is the optimal product mix?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate Contribution Margin per Machine Hour**

**Product A:**
- CM per unit: $50
- Hours per unit: 2
- **CM per hour = $50 ÷ 2 = $25 per hour**

**Product B:**
- CM per unit: $40
- Hours per unit: 1
- **CM per hour = $40 ÷ 1 = $40 per hour**

**Step 2: Rank Products**
- Product B: $40 per hour (higher - make first)
- Product A: $25 per hour (lower - make second)

**Step 3: Allocate Resources**

**Product B (make first):**
- Demand: 500 units
- Hours needed: 500 × 1 = 500 hours
- Hours available: 1,000
- **Make 500 units of B, use 500 hours**

**Product A (make second):**
- Hours remaining: 1,000 - 500 = 500 hours
- Hours per unit: 2
- **Can make: 500 ÷ 2 = 250 units of A**

**Optimal Mix:**
- Product B: 500 units
- Product A: 250 units
- Total contribution: (500 × $40) + (250 × $50) = $20,000 + $12,500 = **$32,500**

**Key Insight:** Even though Product A has higher CM per unit, Product B is better because it uses less of the constrained resource (machine hours).

## 4. COMMON CONFUSIONS & MISTAKES

### Confusion 1: Including Sunk Costs
**The Mistake:** Including sunk costs in decision analysis

**The Reality:**
- Sunk costs are **always irrelevant**
- Common trap: "We've already invested $X, we must continue"
- Correct: Ignore sunk costs, focus on future costs/benefits

**Example:**
- Spent $100K on research (sunk)
- Need $50K more to launch
- Expected profit: $30K
- **Wrong:** "We've spent $100K, we must launch" (total loss = $120K)
- **Right:** "Future: spend $50K to make $30K = lose $20K, so don't launch" (total loss = $100K sunk)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Sunk costs = Always irrelevant**
- **"Can I change it?" → No = Ignore**

---

### Confusion 2: Allocated Fixed Costs
**The Mistake:** Treating allocated common fixed costs as relevant

**The Reality:**
- Allocated common fixed costs are **usually irrelevant**
- They don't change if you drop a segment
- Only **avoidable/traceable** fixed costs are relevant

**Example:**
- Product line shows $10K loss
- But $15K of fixed costs are allocated (not avoidable)
- Product actually contributes $5K ($10K loss + $15K allocated = $5K contribution)
- **Don't drop!** The $15K allocated costs will just be allocated elsewhere

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Allocated costs = Usually irrelevant**
- **Only avoidable costs matter**

---

### Confusion 3: Special Order - Using Full Cost
**The Mistake:** Rejecting special order because price < full cost

**The Reality:**
- For special orders, only **variable costs** are relevant (if capacity available)
- Fixed costs are irrelevant (already incurred)
- Accept if price > variable costs

**Example:**
- Full cost: $20 (variable $12 + fixed $8)
- Special price: $15
- **Wrong:** Reject because $15 < $20
- **Right:** Accept because $15 > $12 (variable costs)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Special Order = Price vs. Variable Costs**
- **Not full cost!**

---

### Confusion 4: Product Mix - Per Unit vs. Per Constraint
**The Mistake:** Ranking products by contribution margin per unit when resources are constrained

**The Reality:**
- When resources are limited, rank by **contribution margin per constrained resource**
- Product with highest CM per unit might not be best

**Example:**
- Product A: $50 CM per unit, 2 hours per unit = $25 per hour
- Product B: $40 CM per unit, 1 hour per unit = $40 per hour
- **Wrong:** Make A first (higher CM per unit)
- **Right:** Make B first (higher CM per hour)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Constrained resource = Rank by CM per constraint**
- **Not CM per unit!**

---

### Confusion 5: Opportunity Costs
**The Mistake:** Ignoring opportunity costs because they're not in accounting records

**The Reality:**
- Opportunity costs are **always relevant**
- Even though not recorded, they're real costs
- Must consider what you're giving up

**Example:**
- Using factory space for Product A
- Could rent space for $10K
- **Opportunity cost = $10K** (relevant, even if not recorded)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Opportunity cost = Always relevant**
- **"What am I giving up?"**
