## Balanced Scorecard

---

## 1. BIG PICTURE

### Purpose of This Lecture
The Balanced Scorecard is a **comprehensive performance measurement framework** that looks at performance from multiple perspectives, not just financial. This lecture teaches you:
- Why financial measures alone are insufficient
- The four perspectives of the balanced scorecard
- How to develop performance measures for each perspective
- How the perspectives are linked through cause-and-effect relationships

### Connection to Previous Lectures

- Expands beyond financial measures (ROI, RI)
- Adds non-financial performance measures
- Comprehensive performance measurement

**Builds on All Previous Lectures:**
- Uses concepts from costing, budgeting, variance analysis
- Applies decision-making frameworks
- Integrates all course concepts

**Culminates the Course:**
- Brings together all management accounting concepts
- Provides framework for strategic performance management
- Shows how management accounting supports strategy

### Why This Matters
**For Exams:**
- Balanced scorecard questions are **common** on exams
- You'll identify perspectives, measures, and linkages
- Questions test understanding of non-financial measures
- **High probability exam topic**

**For Real-World Management:**
- Essential for strategic performance management

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS BREAKDOWN

### Concept 1: Limitations of Financial Measures

**What it is:**
Financial measures (like ROI, profit) are important but have limitations. They are:
- **Backward-looking:** Measure past performance
- **Lagging indicators:** Show results after actions taken
- **Can be manipulated:** Short-term focus may harm long-term

**Why it matters:**
- Financial measures alone don't predict future performance
- Need forward-looking measures
- Need non-financial measures that drive financial results

**What problem Balanced Scorecard solves:**
- Adds non-financial measures
- Looks forward, not just backward
- Balances short-term and long-term
- Links strategy to operations

**Examples of Limitations:**
- High ROI today might come from underinvesting (bad for future)
- Cutting R&D improves short-term profit but harms long-term
- Customer satisfaction not captured in financial measures

**Plain Language:**
- "Financial measures tell you what happened, not what will happen"
- Like a rearview mirror - necessary but not enough to drive forward

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Financial = Backward-looking, Lagging**
- **Need forward-looking measures too**

### Concept 2: The Four Perspectives

**What it is:**
The Balanced Scorecard evaluates performance from four perspectives:
1. **Financial**
2. **Customer**
3. **Internal Business Processes**
4. **Learning and Growth**

**Why it exists:**
- Each perspective provides different information
- Together they give complete picture
- Links strategy to operations

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides balanced view of performance
- Links different aspects of business
- Shows cause-and-effect relationships

**Overview:**

1. **Financial Perspective:**
   - "How do we look to shareholders?"
   - Measures: ROI, profit, revenue growth, cash flow

2. **Customer Perspective:**
   - "How do customers see us?"
   - Measures: Customer satisfaction, market share, customer retention

3. **Internal Business Processes:**
   - "What must we excel at?"
   - Measures: Quality, cycle time, process efficiency

4. **Learning and Growth:**
   - "How can we continue to improve?"
   - Measures: Employee satisfaction, training, innovation

**Plain Language:**
- "Look at performance from four angles: Money, Customers, Operations, People"
- Like a four-legged table - need all four for stability

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Four Perspectives: Financial, Customer, Internal Processes, Learning & Growth**
- **FCIL** (Financial, Customer, Internal, Learning)

### Concept 7: Cause-and-Effect Relationships

**What it is:**
The balanced scorecard shows how the four perspectives are linked. Improvements in one perspective drive improvements in others.

**Why it exists:**
- Perspectives are not independent
- Shows how strategy works
- Links actions to results

**What problem it solves:**
- Explains how to achieve financial results
- Shows strategy implementation
- Links leading and lagging indicators

**The Chain:**
1. **Learning & Growth** (Foundation)
   - Invest in people and systems
   
2. **Internal Processes** (Operations)
   - Improved capabilities lead to better processes
   
3. **Customer** (Value Delivery)
   - Better processes lead to customer satisfaction
   
4. **Financial** (Results)
   - Happy customers lead to financial results

**Example:**
- Train employees (Learning & Growth)
- → Improve quality (Internal Processes)
- → Increase customer satisfaction (Customer)
- → Increase sales and profit (Financial)

**Plain Language:**
- "The perspectives are linked - improve one, others follow"
- Like a chain reaction - start at the foundation

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Learning → Processes → Customer → Financial**
- **Leading indicators → Lagging indicators**

## 3. WALK THROUGH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Identifying Perspectives

**Scenario:**
Company uses these performance measures:
1. ROI
2. Customer satisfaction score
3. Employee training hours
4. Defect rate
5. Market share
6. Revenue growth
7. Cycle time
8. Employee turnover

**Question:** Classify each measure by balanced scorecard perspective.

**Solution:**

**Financial Perspective:**

---

### Example 2: Cause-and-Effect Chain

**Scenario:**
Company wants to improve financial performance (ROI).

**Question:** Develop a cause-and-effect chain from Learning & Growth to Financial.

**Solution:**

**Learning & Growth (Foundation):**
- **Measure:** Increase employee training hours by 20%
- **Action:** Invest in training programs

**Internal Business Processes (Operations):**
- **Measure:** Reduce defect rate from 5% to 2%
- **Link:** Better trained employees → Better quality
- **Action:** Improved processes lead to fewer defects

**Customer (Value Delivery):**
- **Measure:** Increase customer satisfaction from 75% to 85%
- **Link:** Fewer defects → Happier customers
- **Action:** Higher quality products increase satisfaction

**Financial (Results):**
- **Measure:** Increase ROI from 15% to 18%
- **Link:** Happy customers → More sales → Higher profit
- **Action:** Customer satisfaction drives revenue and profit

**Chain:**
Training → Quality → Customer Satisfaction → ROI

### Example 3: Developing Balanced Scorecard Measures

**Scenario:**
Retail company wants to develop balanced scorecard.

**Question:** Suggest 2-3 measures for each perspective.

**Solution:**

**Financial Perspective:**

3. Employee turnover (retention)

**Key:** Measures should be:
- Linked to strategy
- Measurable
- Actionable
- Balanced across perspectives

## 4. COMMON CONFUSIONS & MISTAKES

### Confusion 1: Financial Measures Are Unimportant
**The Mistake:** Thinking balanced scorecard replaces financial measures

**The Reality:**
- Financial measures are still critical
- They're the "outcome" measures
- Balanced scorecard **adds** to financial measures, doesn't replace them

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Financial measures = Outcomes**
- **Other measures = Drivers**
- **Need both**

---

### Confusion 2: All Measures Are Equal
**The Mistake:** Thinking all perspectives are equally important

**The Reality:**
- Learning & Growth is the **foundation**
- Financial is the **outcome**
- Cause-and-effect chain matters
- Importance depends on strategy

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Learning & Growth = Foundation**
- **Financial = Outcome**
- **Chain matters**

---

### Confusion 3: Measures Should Be Financial
**The Mistake:** Trying to make all measures financial

**The Reality:**
- Non-financial measures are critical
- They're leading indicators
- Financial measures are lagging indicators
- Need both types

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Financial = Lagging (results)**
- **Non-financial = Leading (drivers)**
- **Need leading indicators**

---

### Confusion 4: One-Size-Fits-All
**The Mistake:** Thinking all companies use same measures

**The Reality:**
- Measures should match strategy
- Different companies need different measures
- Must be tailored to company

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Measures = Strategy-specific**
- **Tailor to company**

---

### Confusion 5: Ignoring Cause-and-Effect
**The Mistake:** Treating perspectives as independent

**The Reality:**
- Perspectives are linked
- Cause-and-effect chain is critical
- Shows how to achieve results

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Perspectives are linked**
- **Learning → Processes → Customer → Financial**

---
