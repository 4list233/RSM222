# Class 3: Chapters 4 & 5 - Teaching Notes
## Job Order Costing

---

## 1. BIG PICTURE

### Purpose of This Lecture
Job Order Costing is a **cost accumulation system** used when companies produce unique, customized products or services. This lecture teaches you how to:
- Track costs for individual jobs (custom orders, projects, batches)
- Assign manufacturing costs to specific jobs
- Calculate the total cost and unit cost of each job
- Understand the flow of costs through the accounting system

### Connection to Previous Lectures
**Builds on Class 1:**
- Uses cost classification (direct materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead)
- Applies the direct vs. indirect cost distinction
- Uses product costs vs. period costs

**Sets up for:**
- **Class 4 (Process Costing):** Contrast - job order for unique items vs. process for identical items
- **Class 5 (ABC):** More sophisticated overhead allocation methods
- **Class 6 (Variable Costing):** Different way to value inventory
- **All costing topics:** Foundation for understanding how costs flow through a manufacturing system

### Why This Matters
**For Exams:**
- Job order costing calculations are **very common** on exams
- You'll need to calculate overhead rates, apply overhead, and find job costs
- Questions often test understanding of cost flow
- **High probability exam topic**

**For Real-World Management:**
- Used in construction, custom manufacturing, professional services
- Essential for pricing custom work
- Helps track profitability of individual jobs
- Critical for cost control

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS BREAKDOWN

### Concept 1: Job Order Costing System

**What it is:**
A costing system that accumulates costs for each individual job, order, or batch. Each job is unique and costs are tracked separately.

**Why it exists:**
- When products are customized, each job has different costs
- Need to know the cost of each specific job for pricing and profitability
- Required for accurate financial reporting (inventory valuation)

**What problem it solves:**
- Answers: "What did it cost to make this specific order?"
- Enables accurate pricing of custom work
- Tracks profitability by job
- Provides cost information for decision-making

**When to Use:**
- Custom products (furniture, construction, printing)
- Professional services (law firms, consulting)
- Batch production where each batch is different
- Any situation where costs vary significantly by job

**Plain Language:**
- "Each job gets its own cost tracking sheet"
- Like a restaurant bill - each table (job) has its own tab (cost record)

**Memory Anchor:**
- Job Order = "One job, one cost record"
- Think: Custom work = Job order costing

---

### Concept 2: Job Cost Sheet

**What it is:**
A document that accumulates all costs assigned to a specific job. It's like a "receipt" for everything that goes into making that job.

**Why it exists:**
- Central place to track all job costs
- Used to calculate total job cost and unit cost
- Provides audit trail
- Basis for billing customers

**What problem it solves:**
- Organizes cost information by job
- Makes it easy to see what a job cost
- Enables accurate pricing and profitability analysis

**Components:**
1. **Direct Materials:** Materials directly traceable to the job
2. **Direct Labor:** Labor directly traceable to the job
3. **Manufacturing Overhead:** Allocated overhead costs
4. **Total Job Cost:** Sum of all three
5. **Unit Cost:** Total job cost ÷ number of units in job

**Plain Language:**
- "A detailed receipt showing everything that went into making this job"
- Example: Job #101 cost sheet shows $500 materials + $300 labor + $200 overhead = $1,000 total

**Memory Anchor:**
- Job Cost Sheet = "Job's expense report"
- Three cost categories: Materials, Labor, Overhead

---

### Concept 3: Cost Flow in Job Order Costing

**What it is:**
The path that costs take through the accounting system from when they're incurred until they become expenses.

**Why it exists:**
- Shows how costs move through the system
- Essential for understanding journal entries
- Helps track inventory and cost of goods sold

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides systematic way to record costs
- Ensures costs are properly classified
- Links to financial statements

**Cost Flow Steps:**

1. **Purchase Materials**
   - Raw Materials Inventory (asset) increases
   - Accounts Payable (liability) increases

2. **Use Direct Materials**
   - Raw Materials Inventory decreases
   - Work in Process (WIP) Inventory increases
   - Recorded on job cost sheet

3. **Incur Direct Labor**
   - Wages Payable (liability) increases
   - Work in Process Inventory increases
   - Recorded on job cost sheet

4. **Apply Manufacturing Overhead**
   - Work in Process Inventory increases
   - Manufacturing Overhead (control account) increases
   - Recorded on job cost sheet

5. **Complete Job**
   - Work in Process Inventory decreases
   - Finished Goods Inventory increases

6. **Sell Job**
   - Finished Goods Inventory decreases
   - Cost of Goods Sold (expense) increases

**Plain Language:**
- Materials → Work in Process → Finished Goods → Cost of Goods Sold
- Think: "Costs follow the product through production"

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Flow:** Raw Materials → WIP → Finished Goods → COGS
- Each step moves costs to the next inventory account

---

### Concept 4: Manufacturing Overhead Application

**What it is:**
The process of assigning manufacturing overhead costs to jobs. Since overhead is indirect, it cannot be traced directly to jobs, so it must be **allocated** using a predetermined rate.

**Why it exists:**
- Overhead costs (rent, utilities, indirect labor) benefit all jobs but can't be traced directly
- Need a fair way to assign these costs to jobs
- Required for accurate job costing

**What problem it solves:**
- Ensures all manufacturing costs are included in job costs
- Provides systematic allocation method
- Enables accurate pricing

**The Process:**

1. **Estimate Total Overhead** (at beginning of period)
   - Example: Expect $100,000 in overhead for the year

2. **Choose Allocation Base** (activity measure)
   - Common bases: Direct labor hours, machine hours, direct labor cost
   - Example: Use direct labor hours, expect 10,000 hours

3. **Calculate Predetermined Overhead Rate (POHR)**
   - POHR = Estimated Total Overhead ÷ Estimated Allocation Base
   - Example: $100,000 ÷ 10,000 hours = **$10 per direct labor hour**

4. **Apply Overhead to Jobs** (during the period)
   - Applied Overhead = POHR × Actual Allocation Base Used
   - Example: Job uses 50 hours → Applied Overhead = $10 × 50 = **$500**

**Plain Language:**
- "We estimate overhead, divide by expected activity, get a rate, then apply that rate to each job based on how much activity it used"
- Like a tax rate: estimate total tax, divide by income, get rate, apply to each person

**Memory Anchor:**
- **POHR = Estimated Overhead ÷ Estimated Base**
- **Applied = POHR × Actual Base Used**

**Key Insight:**
- Applied overhead may differ from actual overhead (we'll see this in overhead variance)

---

### Concept 5: Overhead Variance (Underapplied vs. Overapplied)

**What it is:**
The difference between actual manufacturing overhead incurred and overhead applied to jobs.

**Why it exists:**
- We estimate overhead at the beginning of the period
- Actual overhead often differs from estimates
- Need to account for this difference

**What problem it solves:**
- Ensures all overhead costs are eventually expensed
- Adjusts for estimation errors
- Provides information for future estimates

**Calculation:**
- **Actual Overhead:** What we actually spent
- **Applied Overhead:** What we allocated to jobs using POHR
- **Variance = Actual - Applied**

**Two Cases:**

1. **Underapplied Overhead** (Actual > Applied)
   - We didn't apply enough overhead to jobs
   - Actual overhead was higher than estimated
   - **Debit balance** in Manufacturing Overhead account

2. **Overapplied Overhead** (Applied > Actual)
   - We applied too much overhead to jobs
   - Actual overhead was lower than estimated
   - **Credit balance** in Manufacturing Overhead account

**Disposition:**
- If small amount: Close to Cost of Goods Sold
- If large amount: Allocate to WIP, Finished Goods, and COGS based on ending balances

**Plain Language:**
- Underapplied = "We didn't charge jobs enough for overhead"
- Overapplied = "We charged jobs too much for overhead"
- Need to adjust at year-end

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Underapplied = Debit balance = Not enough applied**
- **Overapplied = Credit balance = Too much applied**

---

### Concept 6: Journal Entries in Job Order Costing

**What it is:**
The accounting entries that record cost flows in a job order costing system.

**Why it exists:**
- Required for proper financial accounting
- Tracks costs through the system
- Links to financial statements

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides systematic record-keeping
- Ensures costs are properly classified
- Enables financial statement preparation

**Key Journal Entries:**

1. **Purchase Raw Materials**
   ```
   Raw Materials Inventory        XXX
       Accounts Payable                          XXX
   ```

2. **Issue Direct Materials to Production**
   ```
   Work in Process Inventory     XXX
       Raw Materials Inventory                   XXX
   ```

3. **Record Direct Labor**
   ```
   Work in Process Inventory     XXX
       Wages Payable                             XXX
   ```

4. **Apply Manufacturing Overhead**
   ```
   Work in Process Inventory     XXX
       Manufacturing Overhead                   XXX
   ```

5. **Record Actual Overhead Costs**
   ```
   Manufacturing Overhead        XXX
       Various Accounts (Cash, A/P, etc.)       XXX
   ```

6. **Complete Job (Transfer to Finished Goods)**
   ```
   Finished Goods Inventory      XXX
       Work in Process Inventory                XXX
   ```

7. **Sell Job (Record COGS)**
   ```
   Cost of Goods Sold            XXX
       Finished Goods Inventory                 XXX
   ```

**Plain Language:**
- Each entry moves costs to the next stage
- Debit = where cost is going
- Credit = where cost is coming from

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Debit = Destination, Credit = Source**
- Costs flow: Raw Materials → WIP → Finished Goods → COGS

## 3. WALK THROUGH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Complete Job Costing Problem

**Scenario:**
- Company uses job order costing
- Predetermined overhead rate: $5 per direct labor hour
- Job #101: Custom table
  - Direct materials: $200
  - Direct labor: 10 hours @ $15/hour = $150
  - Units produced: 1 table

**Questions:**
1. Calculate applied overhead
2. Calculate total job cost
3. Calculate unit cost
4. Prepare journal entries

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Applied Overhead**
- Direct labor hours used: 10 hours
- POHR: $5 per hour
- Applied Overhead = $5 × 10 = **$50**

**Step 2: Total Job Cost**
- Direct Materials: $200
- Direct Labor: $150
- Applied Overhead: $50
- **Total Job Cost = $400**

**Step 3: Unit Cost**
- Units produced: 1
- Unit Cost = $400 ÷ 1 = **$400 per table**

**Step 4: Journal Entries**

**Issue materials:**
```
Work in Process Inventory        200
    Raw Materials Inventory                   200
```

**Record labor:**
```
Work in Process Inventory        150
    Wages Payable                             150
```

**Apply overhead:**
```
Work in Process Inventory         50
    Manufacturing Overhead                    50
```

**Complete job:**
```
Finished Goods Inventory         400
    Work in Process Inventory                400
```

### Example 2: Overhead Variance

**Scenario:**
- Estimated overhead: $120,000
- Estimated direct labor hours: 8,000
- Actual overhead: $125,000
- Actual direct labor hours: 8,500
- Overhead applied to jobs: $127,500

**Questions:**
1. Calculate predetermined overhead rate
2. Calculate overhead variance
3. Is it underapplied or overapplied?
4. How to dispose of it?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Predetermined Overhead Rate**
- POHR = $120,000 ÷ 8,000 hours = **$15 per direct labor hour**

**Step 2: Overhead Variance**
- Actual Overhead: $125,000
- Applied Overhead: $127,500
- Variance = $125,000 - $127,500 = **-$2,500**
- Negative = **Overapplied** (we applied more than actual)

**Step 3: Interpretation**
- Overapplied by $2,500
- We charged jobs $2,500 more than actual overhead
- Credit balance in Manufacturing Overhead account

**Step 4: Disposition**
- If small amount: Close to COGS
  ```
  Manufacturing Overhead         2,500
      Cost of Goods Sold                      2,500
  ```
- This reduces COGS (because we overcharged jobs)

## 4. COMMON CONFUSIONS & MISTAKES

### Confusion 1: Applied vs. Actual Overhead
**The Mistake:** Confusing applied overhead with actual overhead

**The Reality:**
- **Actual Overhead:** What we actually spent (rent, utilities, etc.)
- **Applied Overhead:** What we allocated to jobs using POHR
- These are **different** and usually don't match

**Example:**
- Actual overhead = $100,000 (what we paid)
- Applied overhead = $95,000 (what we charged to jobs)
- Difference = $5,000 underapplied

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Actual = Real money spent**
- **Applied = Estimated allocation to jobs**

---

### Confusion 2: POHR Calculation - Using Wrong Base
**The Mistake:** Using actual amounts instead of estimated amounts in POHR

**The Reality:**
- POHR uses **estimated** overhead and **estimated** base
- Applied overhead uses **actual** base used
- Don't mix them up!

**Correct:**
- POHR = Estimated Overhead ÷ Estimated Base
- Applied = POHR × Actual Base Used

**Wrong:**
- POHR = Actual Overhead ÷ Actual Base ✗

**Memory Anchor:**
- **POHR = Estimates (set at beginning of period)**
- **Applied = POHR × Actual Activity (during period)**

---

### Confusion 3: Overhead Variance Sign
**The Mistake:** Getting confused about underapplied vs. overapplied

**The Reality:**
- **Underapplied:** Actual > Applied (debit balance, not enough applied)
- **Overapplied:** Applied > Actual (credit balance, too much applied)

**Memory Trick:**
- **Under**applied = **Under**charged jobs = Need to add more
- **Over**applied = **Over**charged jobs = Need to reduce

**Memory Anchor:**
- Underapplied = Debit = Not enough
- Overapplied = Credit = Too much

---

### Confusion 4: Cost Flow - Which Account?
**The Mistake:** Putting costs in wrong inventory accounts

**The Reality:**
- **Raw Materials:** Unused materials
- **Work in Process:** Jobs being worked on
- **Finished Goods:** Completed jobs not yet sold
- **Cost of Goods Sold:** Cost of jobs that were sold

**Flow:** Raw Materials → WIP → Finished Goods → COGS

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Raw = Not used yet**
- **WIP = In production**
- **Finished = Done, not sold**
- **COGS = Sold**

---

### Confusion 5: Direct Materials vs. Indirect Materials
**The Mistake:** Thinking all materials go to Work in Process directly

**The Reality:**
- **Direct Materials:** Go to Work in Process (traceable to jobs)
- **Indirect Materials:** Go to Manufacturing Overhead (part of overhead)
- Both come from Raw Materials Inventory

**Example:**
- Wood for table (direct) → WIP
- Glue for table (indirect) → Manufacturing Overhead

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Direct materials = WIP**
- **Indirect materials = Overhead**
