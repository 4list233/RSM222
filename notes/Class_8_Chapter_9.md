A comprehensive financial plan that includes all individual budgets. It's the "big picture" that coordinates all aspects of the business.

**Why it exists:**
- Coordinates all departments
- Ensures plans are consistent
- Provides complete financial picture
- Links operational plans to financial results

**What problem it solves:**
- Prevents departments from working at cross-purposes
- Ensures resources are allocated properly
- Provides integrated plan

**Components:**
1. **Operating Budgets:**
   - Sales Budget
   - Production Budget
   - Direct Materials Budget

   - Manufacturing Overhead Budget
   - Selling & Administrative Budget
   - Budgeted Income Statement

2. **Financial Budgets:**
   - Cash Budget
   - Budgeted Balance Sheet
   - Capital Expenditures Budget

**Plain Language:**
- "The master plan that includes all the smaller plans"
- Like a blueprint for a house - includes all the detailed plans

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Master Budget = All budgets together**
- **Operating + Financial = Master Budget**

---

### Concept 2: Sales Budget

**What it is:**
The starting point of the master budget. Shows expected sales in units and dollars for the budget period.

**Why it exists:**
- All other budgets depend on sales
- Drives production, materials, labor needs
- Foundation for entire budget process

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides sales targets
- Basis for all other budgets
- Links to strategic goals

**Format:**
```
Sales Budget
Q1        Q2        Q3        Q4        Total
Units     XXX       XXX       XXX        XXX       XXX
Price     $XX       $XX       $XX        $XX       $XX
Sales     $XXX      $XXX      $XXX       $XXX      $XXX
```

**Key Points:**
- Usually prepared by quarter or month
- Based on sales forecasts
- Often the most uncertain budget

**Plain Language:**
- "How much do we expect to sell?"
- Starting point - everything else flows from here

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Sales Budget = Starting point**
- **All other budgets depend on sales**

---

### Concept 3: Production Budget

**What it is:**
Shows the number of units that must be produced to meet sales needs and desired ending inventory.

**Why it exists:**
- Can't sell what you don't have
- Need to plan production
- Must account for inventory changes

**What problem it solves:**
- Determines production requirements
- Links sales to production
- Plans inventory levels

**Formula:**
- **Units to Produce = Budgeted Sales + Desired Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory**

**Key Points:**
- Ending inventory of one period = Beginning inventory of next period
- Must maintain desired inventory levels
- Production may not equal sales (due to inventory changes)

**Plain Language:**
- "How many units do we need to make?"
- Sales + Ending inventory - Beginning inventory = Production needed

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Production = Sales + Ending - Beginning**
- **Ending of one = Beginning of next**

---

### Concept 4: Direct Materials Budget

**What it is:**
Shows the quantity and cost of direct materials needed for production and desired ending materials inventory.

**Why it exists:**
- Need materials to produce
- Must plan purchases
- Affects cash flow

**What problem it solves:**
- Determines materials purchases
- Plans materials inventory
- Links to cash budget

**Formula:**
- **Materials Needed for Production = Units to Produce × Materials per Unit**
- **Materials to Purchase = Materials Needed + Desired Ending Materials - Beginning Materials**

**Key Points:**
- Based on production budget
- Must account for materials inventory
- Purchases may not equal usage (due to inventory changes)

**Plain Language:**
- "How much material do we need to buy?"
- Production needs + Ending inventory - Beginning inventory = Purchases

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Purchases = Production Needs + Ending - Beginning**
- **Based on production budget**

---

### Concept 5: Direct Labor Budget

**What it is:**
Shows the direct labor hours and cost needed for production.

**Why it exists:**
- Need labor to produce
- Affects cash flow (wages)
- Used for planning

**What problem it solves:**
- Determines labor needs
- Plans labor costs
- Links to cash budget

**Formula:**
- **Labor Hours Needed = Units to Produce × Hours per Unit**
- **Labor Cost = Labor Hours × Wage Rate per Hour**

**Key Points:**
- Based on production budget
- Usually variable cost (hours × rate)
- May need to hire/fire workers based on budget

**Plain Language:**
- "How much labor do we need and what will it cost?"
- Production × Hours per unit × Rate = Labor cost

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Labor = Production × Hours × Rate**
- **Based on production budget**

---

### Concept 6: Manufacturing Overhead Budget

**What it is:**
Shows expected manufacturing overhead costs for the budget period.

**Why it exists:**
- Overhead is significant cost
- Need to plan overhead
- Used to calculate predetermined overhead rate

**What problem it solves:**
- Plans overhead costs
- Separates variable and fixed overhead
- Provides basis for overhead rate

**Format:**
- Variable Overhead (based on activity)
- Fixed Overhead (constant)
- Total Overhead
- Often shows overhead rate

**Key Points:**
- Variable overhead depends on activity level
- Fixed overhead is constant
- Used to calculate POHR for next period

**Plain Language:**
- "What will overhead cost?"
- Variable + Fixed = Total overhead

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Overhead = Variable + Fixed**
- **Based on production/activity level**

---

### Concept 7: Cash Budget

**What it is:**
Shows expected cash receipts and disbursements, and ending cash balance.

**Why it exists:**
- Critical for cash flow management
- Prevents cash shortages
- Plans financing needs

**What problem it solves:**
- Manages cash flow
- Identifies financing needs
- Prevents cash crises

**Components:**
1. **Beginning Cash Balance**
2. **Cash Receipts:**
   - Cash sales
   - Collections from credit sales
3. **Cash Disbursements:**
   - Materials purchases
   - Labor
   - Overhead
   - Selling & admin
   - Capital expenditures
   - Loan payments
4. **Ending Cash Balance**
5. **Financing:**
   - Borrowing if needed
   - Repayments

**Key Points:**
- Timing matters (when cash comes in vs. goes out)
- Accounts receivable collections (not all sales are cash)
- Accounts payable payments (not all purchases are cash)
- May need to borrow if cash is short

**Plain Language:**
- "How much cash will we have?"
- Beginning + Receipts - Disbursements = Ending
- May need to borrow if negative

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Cash = Beginning + Receipts - Disbursements**
- **Timing matters!**

---

### Concept 8: Budget Relationships

**What it is:**
Understanding how budgets are connected and depend on each other.

**Why it exists:**
- Budgets are not independent
- Must understand the flow
- Errors cascade through budgets

**What problem it solves:**
- Ensures budgets are consistent
- Shows budget preparation order
- Helps identify errors

**Budget Flow:**
1. **Sales Budget** → Starting point
2. **Production Budget** → Based on sales
3. **Direct Materials Budget** → Based on production
4. **Direct Labor Budget** → Based on production
5. **Manufacturing Overhead Budget** → Based on production/activity
6. **Selling & Admin Budget** → Based on sales
7. **Cash Budget** → Uses all above budgets
8. **Budgeted Income Statement** → Uses all operating budgets
9. **Budgeted Balance Sheet** → Uses income statement and cash budget

**Plain Language:**
- "Budgets flow from sales through production to financial statements"
- Like a waterfall - each budget flows into the next

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Sales → Production → Materials/Labor/Overhead → Cash → Financial Statements**

## 3. WALK THROUGH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Production Budget

**Scenario:**
- Q1 Sales: 10,000 units
- Q2 Sales: 12,000 units
- Q3 Sales: 15,000 units
- Q4 Sales: 11,000 units
- Desired ending inventory: 20% of next quarter's sales
- Beginning inventory Q1: 2,000 units

**Question:** Prepare production budget for all quarters.

**Solution:**

**Q1:**
- Budgeted Sales: 10,000
- Desired Ending: 20% × 12,000 = 2,400
- Beginning: 2,000
- **Units to Produce = 10,000 + 2,400 - 2,000 = 10,400**

**Q2:**
- Budgeted Sales: 12,000
- Desired Ending: 20% × 15,000 = 3,000
- Beginning: 2,400 (ending from Q1)
- **Units to Produce = 12,000 + 3,000 - 2,400 = 12,600**

**Q3:**
- Budgeted Sales: 15,000
- Desired Ending: 20% × 11,000 = 2,200
- Beginning: 3,000 (ending from Q2)
- **Units to Produce = 15,000 + 2,200 - 3,000 = 14,200**

**Q4:**
- Budgeted Sales: 11,000
- Desired Ending: 2,000 (assume for next year)
- Beginning: 2,200 (ending from Q3)
- **Units to Produce = 11,000 + 2,000 - 2,200 = 10,800**

---

### Example 2: Direct Materials Budget

**Scenario:**
- Production (from production budget): 10,400 units
- Materials per unit: 3 pounds
- Desired ending materials: 10% of next quarter's production needs
- Beginning materials: 3,000 pounds
- Q2 production needs: 12,600 units × 3 = 37,800 pounds
- Material cost: $2 per pound

**Question:** Calculate materials purchases for Q1.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Materials Needed for Production**
- Production: 10,400 units
- Materials per unit: 3 pounds
- **Materials Needed = 10,400 × 3 = 31,200 pounds**

**Step 2: Desired Ending Materials**
- Next quarter's needs: 37,800 pounds
- 10% of 37,800 = **3,780 pounds**

**Step 3: Materials to Purchase**
- Materials Needed: 31,200
- Desired Ending: 3,780
- Beginning: 3,000
- **Purchases = 31,200 + 3,780 - 3,000 = 31,980 pounds**

**Step 4: Cost of Purchases**
- Purchases: 31,980 pounds
- Cost per pound: $2
- **Total Cost = 31,980 × $2 = $63,960**

---

### Example 3: Cash Budget (Simplified)

**Scenario:**
- Beginning cash: $10,000
- Cash sales: 30% of total sales ($100,000) = $30,000
- Credit sales collected: 70% in same month, 30% next month
- Previous month credit sales: $50,000
- Cash disbursements: $60,000
- Minimum cash: $5,000

**Question:** Calculate ending cash and financing needs.

**Solution:**

**Cash Receipts:**
- Cash sales: $30,000
- Collections from current month credit: 70% × $70,000 = $49,000
- Collections from previous month: 30% × $50,000 = $15,000
- **Total Receipts = $94,000**

**Ending Cash (Before Financing):**
- Beginning: $10,000
- Receipts: $94,000
- Disbursements: ($60,000)
- **Ending = $44,000**

**Financing:**
- Ending cash: $44,000
- Minimum required: $5,000
- **No borrowing needed** (ending > minimum)

## 4. COMMON CONFUSIONS & MISTAKES

### Confusion 1: Production vs. Sales
**The Mistake:** Making production equal to sales

**The Reality:**
- Production = Sales + Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory
- Production and sales are usually different (due to inventory changes)

**Example:**
- Sales: 10,000 units
- Ending inventory: 2,000 units
- Beginning inventory: 1,000 units
- Production = 10,000 + 2,000 - 1,000 = 11,000 units (not 10,000!)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Production ≠ Sales (usually)**
- **Production = Sales + Ending - Beginning**

---

### Confusion 2: Ending Inventory Relationships
**The Mistake:** Forgetting that ending of one period = beginning of next

**The Reality:**
- Ending inventory Q1 = Beginning inventory Q2
- Must be consistent across periods

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Ending of one = Beginning of next**
- **Always check consistency**

---

### Confusion 3: Materials Purchases vs. Usage
**The Mistake:** Making purchases equal to usage

**The Reality:**
- Purchases = Usage + Ending Materials - Beginning Materials
- Purchases and usage differ due to materials inventory changes

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Purchases ≠ Usage (usually)**
- **Purchases = Usage + Ending - Beginning**

---

### Confusion 4: Cash vs. Accrual Timing
**The Mistake:** Treating all sales as cash and all purchases as cash

**The Reality:**
- Cash budget uses **cash basis** (when cash actually flows)
- Sales on credit → cash received later
- Purchases on credit → cash paid later
- Timing matters!

**Example:**
- January sales: $100,000 (50% cash, 50% credit)
- Credit sales collected: 60% in January, 40% in February
- January cash receipts = $50,000 (cash) + $30,000 (60% of credit) = $80,000
- Not $100,000!

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Cash budget = Cash basis**
- **Timing of collections/payments matters**

---

### Confusion 5: Budget Preparation Order
**The Mistake:** Preparing budgets in wrong order

**The Reality:**
- Must follow logical order:
  1. Sales (starting point)
  2. Production (based on sales)
  3. Materials/Labor/Overhead (based on production)
  4. Cash (uses all above)
  5. Financial statements (uses all above)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Sales → Production → Materials/Labor/Overhead → Cash → Statements**

---
