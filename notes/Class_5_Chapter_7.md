## Activity-Based Costing (ABC)

---

## 1. BIG PICTURE

### Purpose of This Lecture
Activity-Based Costing (ABC) is an **advanced overhead allocation method** that allocates overhead costs to products based on the activities they consume, rather than a single volume-based measure. This lecture teaches you:
- Why traditional costing can distort product costs
- How to identify cost drivers and activities
- How to allocate overhead using multiple activity cost pools
- How ABC provides more accurate product costs

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS BREAKDOWN

### Concept 1: Limitations of Traditional Costing

**What it is:**
Traditional costing systems (job order, process) allocate overhead using a single volume-based measure (e.g., direct labor hours, machine hours). This can lead to **cost distortion**.

**Why it's a problem:**
- Assumes all overhead costs are driven by volume
- Simple products subsidize complex products (or vice versa)
- Can lead to incorrect product costs and bad decisions

**What problem ABC solves:**
- Traditional: One overhead rate for everything
- ABC: Multiple overhead rates based on activities
- More accurate product costs

**Example of Cost Distortion:**
- **Simple Product A:** Low volume, simple production
- **Complex Product B:** High volume, complex production (many setups, inspections)
- **Traditional Costing:** Uses direct labor hours
  - Product A: 1,000 hours → Gets large share of overhead
  - Product B: 2,000 hours → Gets larger share, but may not reflect complexity
- **Problem:** Product B uses more activities (setups, inspections) but traditional costing may not capture this
- **Result:** Product A may be overcosted, Product B undercosted

**Plain Language:**
- Traditional = "One size fits all" overhead allocation
- ABC = "Custom fit" overhead allocation based on what each product actually uses

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Traditional:** Single overhead rate, volume-based
- **ABC:** Multiple overhead rates, activity-based

---

### Concept 2: Activity-Based Costing System

**What it is:**
A costing system that allocates overhead costs to products based on the activities they consume. Uses multiple cost pools, each with its own cost driver.

**Why it exists:**
- Overhead costs are driven by different activities, not just volume
- More accurate product costs lead to better decisions
- Helps identify cost drivers and manage activities

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides more accurate product costs
- Reduces cost distortion
- Links costs to activities that cause them
- Enables activity-based management

**Key Principles:**
1. **Activities consume resources** (costs)
2. **Products consume activities**
3. **Allocate costs based on activity consumption**

**Plain Language:**
- "Track what activities each product uses, then charge it for those activities"
- Like a restaurant: Instead of one price for all meals, charge based on what you actually order

**Memory Anchor:**
- **ABC = Activities → Products**
- **Resources → Activities → Products**

---

### Concept 3: Cost Pools and Cost Drivers

**What it is:**
- **Cost Pool:** A grouping of overhead costs related to a specific activity
- **Cost Driver (Activity Driver):** A measure of activity that causes costs to be incurred

**Why it exists:**
- Groups similar costs together
- Identifies what causes costs
- Provides basis for allocation

**What problem it solves:**
- Organizes overhead costs logically
- Links costs to activities
- Enables accurate allocation

**Common Cost Pools and Drivers:**

| Cost Pool | Cost Driver | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Machine Setup | Number of setups | Each setup costs $X |
| Quality Inspection | Number of inspections | Each inspection costs $X |
| Material Handling | Number of moves | Each move costs $X |
| Order Processing | Number of orders | Each order costs $X |
| Machine Running | Machine hours | Each hour costs $X |

**Plain Language:**
- Cost Pool = "Bucket of costs for one activity"
- Cost Driver = "What we count to allocate those costs"
- Example: Setup costs → Number of setups (driver)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Cost Pool = Group of costs**
- **Cost Driver = Measure of activity**
- **Rate = Cost Pool ÷ Total Driver Activity**

---

### Concept 4: ABC Allocation Process

**What it is:**
The step-by-step process of allocating overhead costs using ABC.

**Why it exists:**
- Provides systematic approach
- Ensures all costs are allocated
- Links to product costs

**What problem it solves:**
- Organizes ABC implementation
- Ensures accuracy
- Provides clear methodology

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Activities**
   - List all major activities that consume resources
   - Example: Setup, Inspection, Material Handling, Machine Running

2. **Assign Costs to Cost Pools**
   - Group overhead costs by activity
   - Example: All setup-related costs → Setup Cost Pool

3. **Identify Cost Drivers**
   - Determine what measures each activity
   - Example: Setup costs → Number of setups

4. **Calculate Activity Rates**
   - Activity Rate = Total Cost Pool ÷ Total Driver Activity
   - Example: Setup Rate = $50,000 ÷ 100 setups = $500 per setup

5. **Allocate Costs to Products**
   - Product Cost = Sum of (Activity Rate × Product's Driver Usage)
   - Example: Product A uses 2 setups → 2 × $500 = $1,000 setup cost

**Plain Language:**
- "Group costs by activity, find rate per activity, charge products based on how much of each activity they use"

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Steps:** Activities → Pools → Drivers → Rates → Allocate

---

### Concept 5: Unit-Level vs. Batch-Level vs. Product-Level vs. Facility-Level Activities

**What it is:**
A classification of activities by the level at which they occur. Important for understanding cost behavior.

**Why it exists:**
- Different activity levels have different cost behaviors
- Helps understand when costs are incurred
- Important for cost management

**What problem it solves:**
- Categorizes activities logically
- Helps understand cost drivers
- Enables better cost management

**Categories:**

1. **Unit-Level Activities**
   - Performed for each unit produced
   - **Driver:** Units produced
   - **Example:** Direct materials, direct labor, machine running time
   - **Cost Behavior:** Variable (total cost changes with units)

2. **Batch-Level Activities**
   - Performed for each batch of units
   - **Driver:** Number of batches
   - **Example:** Setup, material handling, inspection
   - **Cost Behavior:** Fixed per batch, variable with number of batches

3. **Product-Level Activities**
   - Performed to support a product line
   - **Driver:** Product-related (number of products, product complexity)
   - **Example:** Product design, engineering, advertising
   - **Cost Behavior:** Fixed for the product line

4. **Facility-Level Activities**
   - Performed to support the entire facility
   - **Driver:** Facility-wide (hard to allocate)
   - **Example:** Plant management, security, property taxes
   - **Cost Behavior:** Fixed for the facility

**Plain Language:**
- Unit = "Per item" (like per pizza)
- Batch = "Per order" (like per delivery)
- Product = "Per product line" (like per menu category)
- Facility = "For entire restaurant" (like rent)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Unit = Each one**
- **Batch = Each group**
- **Product = Each line**
- **Facility = Everything**

**Key Insight:**
- Traditional costing treats everything as unit-level
- ABC recognizes that many costs are batch, product, or facility-level

### Concept 6: ABC vs. Traditional Costing Comparison

**What it is:**
Understanding the differences between ABC and traditional costing systems.

**Why it exists:**
- Helps understand when to use which system
- Shows advantages and disadvantages
- Explains cost differences

**What problem it solves:**
- Clarifies when ABC is beneficial
- Shows impact of costing method choice
- Helps make costing system decisions

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Traditional Costing | Activity-Based Costing |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Overhead Allocation | Single rate, volume-based | Multiple rates, activity-based |
| Cost Pools | One pool (all overhead) | Multiple pools (by activity) |
| Cost Drivers | Volume-based (DLH, MH) | Activity-based (setups, inspections) |
| Accuracy | Less accurate for diverse products | More accurate |
| Complexity | Simple | More complex |
| Cost | Lower | Higher (more data needed) |
| Best For | Simple, similar products | Diverse, complex products |

**Plain Language:**
- Traditional = "Simple but may be wrong"
- ABC = "Complex but more accurate"

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Traditional:** One rate, volume-based, simple
- **ABC:** Multiple rates, activity-based, accurate

## 3. WALK THROUGH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: ABC vs. Traditional Costing

**Scenario:**
Company produces two products:
- **Product A:** Simple, high volume (10,000 units)
- **Product B:** Complex, low volume (2,000 units)

**Overhead Costs:**
- Setup costs: $60,000
- Inspection costs: $40,000
- Machine running: $100,000
- Total: $200,000

**Activity Usage:**
- Product A: 20 setups, 100 inspections, 5,000 machine hours
- Product B: 80 setups, 400 inspections, 3,000 machine hours
- Total: 100 setups, 500 inspections, 8,000 machine hours

**Direct Labor Hours:**
- Product A: 4,000 hours
- Product B: 2,000 hours
- Total: 6,000 hours

**Questions:**
1. Calculate overhead using traditional costing (DLH)
2. Calculate overhead using ABC
3. Compare the results

**Solution:**

**Traditional Costing:**
- Overhead Rate = $200,000 ÷ 6,000 DLH = $33.33 per DLH
- Product A: 4,000 × $33.33 = **$133,320**
- Product B: 2,000 × $33.33 = **$66,680**

**ABC Costing:**

**Step 1: Calculate Activity Rates**
- Setup Rate = $60,000 ÷ 100 = **$600 per setup**
- Inspection Rate = $40,000 ÷ 500 = **$80 per inspection**
- Machine Rate = $100,000 ÷ 8,000 = **$12.50 per machine hour**

**Step 2: Allocate to Products**

**Product A:**
- Setup: 20 × $600 = $12,000
- Inspection: 100 × $80 = $8,000
- Machine: 5,000 × $12.50 = $62,500
- **Total = $82,500**

**Product B:**
- Setup: 80 × $600 = $48,000
- Inspection: 400 × $80 = $32,000
- Machine: 3,000 × $12.50 = $37,500
- **Total = $117,500**

**Comparison:**
- **Product A:** Traditional $133,320 vs. ABC $82,500 → **Overcosted by $50,820**
- **Product B:** Traditional $66,680 vs. ABC $117,500 → **Undercosted by $50,820**

**Key Insight:** Product B (complex, low volume) was significantly undercosted by traditional costing!

### Example 2: Complete ABC Calculation

**Scenario:**
- Setup Cost Pool: $80,000
- Inspection Cost Pool: $60,000
- Machine Cost Pool: $120,000
- Total Overhead: $260,000

**Activity:**
- Total setups: 200
- Total inspections: 1,000
- Total machine hours: 6,000

**Product X:**
- Uses 30 setups, 150 inspections, 1,200 machine hours
- Produces 5,000 units

**Questions:**
1. Calculate activity rates
2. Allocate overhead to Product X
3. Calculate overhead per unit

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Activity Rates**
- Setup Rate = $80,000 ÷ 200 = **$400 per setup**
- Inspection Rate = $60,000 ÷ 1,000 = **$60 per inspection**
- Machine Rate = $120,000 ÷ 6,000 = **$20 per machine hour**

**Step 2: Allocate to Product X**
- Setup: 30 × $400 = $12,000
- Inspection: 150 × $60 = $9,000
- Machine: 1,200 × $20 = $24,000
- **Total Overhead = $45,000**

**Step 3: Overhead per Unit**
- Units produced: 5,000
- Overhead per unit = $45,000 ÷ 5,000 = **$9 per unit**

## 4. COMMON CONFUSIONS & MISTAKES

### Confusion 1: ABC Always Better
**The Mistake:** Thinking ABC is always better than traditional costing

**The Reality:**
- ABC is **more accurate** but also **more expensive** to implement
- For simple companies with similar products, traditional may be fine
- ABC is most beneficial when:
  - Products are diverse
  - Overhead is significant
  - Cost distortion is likely

**Memory Anchor:**
- **ABC = More accurate but more complex**
- **Use when benefits outweigh costs**

---

### Confusion 2: Cost Driver Selection
**The Mistake:** Choosing wrong cost driver or using volume-based driver for all activities

**The Reality:**
- Cost driver should **cause** the cost
- Not all activities are volume-driven
- Batch-level activities need batch-level drivers

**Example:**
- Setup costs → Number of setups (not units produced!)
- Inspection costs → Number of inspections (not machine hours!)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Driver should cause the cost**
- **Match driver to activity level**

---

### Confusion 3: Activity Levels
**The Mistake:** Treating all activities as unit-level

**The Reality:**
- Many overhead costs are batch, product, or facility-level
- These don't vary with units produced
- ABC recognizes this, traditional doesn't

**Example:**
- Setup cost is the same whether batch is 10 or 1,000 units
- Traditional: Allocates by units (wrong!)
- ABC: Allocates by number of setups (correct!)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Not all costs are unit-level**
- **ABC recognizes different activity levels**

---

### Confusion 4: ABC Calculation Steps
**The Mistake:** Mixing up the order of steps or skipping steps

**The Reality:**
- Must follow steps in order:
  1. Identify activities
  2. Assign costs to pools
  3. Identify drivers
  4. Calculate rates
  5. Allocate to products

**Common Error:** Calculating rates before identifying drivers

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Steps:** Activities → Pools → Drivers → Rates → Allocate

---

### Confusion 5: Facility-Level Costs
**The Mistake:** Trying to allocate facility-level costs to products

**The Reality:**
- Facility-level costs are **hard to allocate** to products
- Often excluded from ABC or allocated arbitrarily
- Examples: Plant management, security, property taxes

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Facility-level = Hard to allocate**
- **May be excluded or allocated arbitrarily**
