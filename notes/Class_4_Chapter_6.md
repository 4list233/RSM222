# Class 4: Chapter 6 - Teaching Notes
## Process Costing

---

## 1. BIG PICTURE

### Purpose of This Lecture
Process Costing is a **cost accumulation system** used when companies produce large quantities of identical or very similar products. This lecture teaches you how to:
- Track costs by production process or department (not by individual job)
- Calculate average unit costs when production is continuous
- Handle work in process (partially completed units) using equivalent units
- Allocate costs between completed units and ending WIP

### Connection to Previous Lectures
**Contrasts with Class 3:**
- **Job Order Costing:** Unique products, costs tracked by job
- **Process Costing:** Identical products, costs tracked by process/department
- Both use same cost elements (DM, DL, OH) but accumulate differently

**Builds on Class 1:**
- Uses cost classification (product costs)
- Applies direct vs. indirect costs

**Sets up for:**
- **Class 5 (ABC):** More sophisticated cost allocation
- **Class 6 (Variable Costing):** Different inventory valuation
- Understanding when to use which costing system

### Why This Matters
**For Exams:**
- Process costing calculations are **very common** on exams
- Equivalent units calculations are frequently tested
- Cost per equivalent unit and cost allocation are high-probability topics
- **High probability exam topic**

**For Real-World Management:**
- Used in industries like chemicals, food processing, oil refining
- Essential for mass production companies
- Helps track costs by production process
- Critical for process improvement and cost control

## 2. CORE CONCEPTS BREAKDOWN

### Concept 1: Process Costing System

**What it is:**
A costing system that accumulates costs by process or department, then averages them over all units produced. Used when products are identical and produced continuously.

**Why it exists:**
- When products are identical, don't need to track individual jobs
- More efficient to average costs over all units
- Costs are accumulated by process/department, not by job

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides cost information for mass production
- Calculates average unit cost efficiently
- Tracks costs by production process

**When to Use:**
- Identical or very similar products (soft drinks, gasoline, paper)
- Continuous or mass production
- Costs are similar for all units
- Production flows through processes/departments

**Comparison with Job Order:**
| Aspect | Job Order Costing | Process Costing |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Products | Unique, customized | Identical, standardized |
| Cost Tracking | By job | By process/department |
| Unit Cost | Total job cost ÷ units in job | Total process cost ÷ equivalent units |
| Work in Process | One WIP per job | WIP by process/department |
| Examples | Custom furniture, construction | Soft drinks, chemicals, food |

**Plain Language:**
- Job Order = "Each order gets its own bill"
- Process = "All units share the same average cost"
- Like a buffet: Job order = à la carte (each item priced separately), Process = all-you-can-eat (one price for everything)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Job Order:** Unique products, track by job
- **Process:** Identical products, track by process

---

### Concept 2: Equivalent Units

**What it is:**
A measure of the amount of work done during a period, expressed in terms of fully completed units. Used to calculate average unit costs when there are partially completed units.

**Why it exists:**
- At end of period, some units are partially complete
- Can't say "we have 100 units" if 50 are only 60% complete
- Need a way to measure work done in terms of complete units

**What problem it solves:**
- Allows calculation of average unit cost when production is incomplete
- Provides fair way to allocate costs between completed units and WIP
- Enables accurate inventory valuation

**Calculation:**
- **Equivalent Units = Actual Units × Percentage Complete**
- Example: 100 units that are 60% complete = 60 equivalent units

**Plain Language:**
- "How many complete units worth of work have we done?"
- Example: If you have 2 pizzas that are each half-made, that's equivalent to 1 complete pizza

**Key Insight:**
- Equivalent units are a **measure of work done**, not physical units
- Used to calculate cost per equivalent unit

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Equivalent Units = Physical Units × % Complete**
- Think: "How many complete units is this work worth?"

---

### Concept 3: Cost Per Equivalent Unit

**What it is:**
The average cost per equivalent unit for a given cost category (materials, conversion). Calculated by dividing total costs by equivalent units.

**Why it exists:**
- Need to know average cost per unit to value inventory
- Different costs (materials vs. conversion) may be added at different stages
- Provides basis for allocating costs

**What problem it solves:**
- Calculates average unit cost when production is incomplete
- Enables cost allocation between completed units and WIP
- Provides cost information for pricing and decision-making

**Formula:**
- **Cost per Equivalent Unit = Total Cost ÷ Equivalent Units**
- Calculated separately for:
  - **Materials** (if materials added at beginning vs. end of process)
  - **Conversion** (direct labor + overhead combined)

**Plain Language:**
- "What's the average cost per unit of work done?"
- Example: $10,000 total cost, 1,000 equivalent units = $10 per equivalent unit

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Cost per EU = Total Cost ÷ Equivalent Units**
- Calculate separately for materials and conversion

---

### Concept 4: Materials vs. Conversion Costs

**What it is:**
Process costing separates costs into two categories:
- **Materials:** Direct materials costs
- **Conversion:** Direct labor + Manufacturing overhead (combined)

**Why it exists:**
- Materials and conversion may be added at different stages of production
- Need to track them separately to calculate equivalent units correctly
- Some processes add all materials at beginning, conversion throughout

**What problem it solves:**
- Allows accurate calculation of equivalent units for each cost type
- Handles situations where materials and conversion are added at different times
- Provides more accurate cost allocation

**Key Scenarios:**

1. **Materials Added at Beginning of Process**
   - If units are 60% complete, materials are 100% complete (all added at start)
   - Materials equivalent units = All units (beginning + started) × 100%

2. **Materials Added at End of Process**
   - If units are 60% complete, materials are 0% complete (not added yet)
   - Materials equivalent units = Only completed units × 100%

3. **Conversion Costs Added Evenly Throughout**
   - Conversion equivalent units = Units × Percentage complete
   - Example: 60% complete = 60% conversion done

**Plain Language:**
- Materials = "Stuff we put in"
- Conversion = "Work we do" (labor + overhead)
- They may be added at different times, so track separately

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Materials = Direct Materials**
- **Conversion = Direct Labor + Overhead**
- Track separately because added at different stages

---

### Concept 5: Weighted-Average Method

**What it is:**
A method of calculating equivalent units and cost per equivalent unit that combines beginning WIP with current period costs. Uses a weighted average of costs.

**Why it exists:**
- Simplifies calculations by averaging all costs together
- Doesn't need to track beginning WIP costs separately
- Most commonly used method

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides simpler calculation method
- Easier to understand and apply
- Works well when costs are relatively stable

**Key Features:**
- **Beginning WIP costs are combined with current period costs**
- **Beginning WIP units are included in equivalent units calculation**
- **One average cost per equivalent unit** (not separate for beginning vs. current)

**Formula:**
- **Cost per EU = (Beginning WIP Cost + Current Period Cost) ÷ Total Equivalent Units**
- Total Equivalent Units includes work done on beginning WIP + work done on units started

**Plain Language:**
- "Mix all costs together (beginning + current) and divide by all work done"
- Like mixing two batches of soup together and finding the average

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Weighted-Average = Mix beginning + current, then average**
- Simpler method, most commonly used

---

### Concept 6: Cost Allocation (Completed Units vs. Ending WIP)

**What it is:**
The process of assigning total costs to:
1. Units completed and transferred out
2. Units remaining in ending WIP

**Why it exists:**
- Need to value finished goods (completed units)
- Need to value ending inventory (WIP)
- Required for financial statements

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides inventory valuations
- Enables calculation of cost of goods manufactured
- Links to financial statements

**Process:**

1. **Calculate Cost per Equivalent Unit** (for materials and conversion)

2. **Allocate Costs to Completed Units:**
   - Completed Units Cost = Units Completed × Cost per EU (Materials + Conversion)

3. **Allocate Costs to Ending WIP:**
   - Ending WIP Cost = Ending WIP Equivalent Units × Cost per EU (Materials + Conversion)

4. **Reconciliation:**
   - Total Costs Allocated = Beginning WIP + Costs Added
   - Completed Units Cost + Ending WIP Cost = Total Costs

**Plain Language:**
- "Divide the total cost between what's done (completed) and what's not done (WIP)"
- Based on equivalent units: more work done = more cost allocated

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Completed Cost = Completed Units × Cost per EU**
- **WIP Cost = WIP Equivalent Units × Cost per EU**
- **Total = Completed + WIP**

## 3. WALK THROUGH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Basic Process Costing - Weighted Average

**Scenario:**
- Beginning WIP: 0 units
- Started during period: 10,000 units
- Completed: 8,000 units
- Ending WIP: 2,000 units (50% complete for conversion)
- Materials added at beginning of process
- Costs: Materials $50,000, Conversion $30,000

**Questions:**
1. Calculate equivalent units
2. Calculate cost per equivalent unit
3. Allocate costs to completed units and ending WIP

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Equivalent Units**

**Materials:**
- Materials added at beginning → all units have materials
- Equivalent units = 8,000 completed + 2,000 ending WIP = **10,000 EU**

**Conversion:**
- Completed: 8,000 × 100% = 8,000 EU
- Ending WIP: 2,000 × 50% = 1,000 EU
- Total Conversion EU = **9,000 EU**

**Step 2: Cost per Equivalent Unit**

**Materials:**
- Cost per EU = $50,000 ÷ 10,000 = **$5 per EU**

**Conversion:**
- Cost per EU = $30,000 ÷ 9,000 = **$3.33 per EU**

**Step 3: Cost Allocation**

**Completed Units:**
- Materials: 8,000 × $5 = $40,000
- Conversion: 8,000 × $3.33 = $26,640
- **Total Completed Cost = $66,640**

**Ending WIP:**
- Materials: 2,000 × $5 = $10,000
- Conversion: 1,000 × $3.33 = $3,330
- **Total Ending WIP Cost = $13,330**

**Reconciliation:**
- Total Costs = $50,000 + $30,000 = $80,000
- Allocated = $66,640 + $13,330 = $80,000 ✓

### Example 2: Process Costing with Beginning WIP (Weighted Average)

**Scenario:**
- Beginning WIP: 2,000 units, 40% complete
  - Materials cost: $8,000 (materials added at beginning)
  - Conversion cost: $4,000
- Started during period: 8,000 units
- Completed: 9,000 units
- Ending WIP: 1,000 units, 60% complete
- Current period costs: Materials $32,000, Conversion $36,000

**Questions:**
1. Calculate equivalent units (weighted average)
2. Calculate cost per equivalent unit
3. Allocate costs

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Equivalent Units (Weighted Average)**

**Materials:**
- Materials added at beginning → all units have materials
- Equivalent units = 9,000 completed + 1,000 ending WIP = **10,000 EU**
- (Beginning WIP already had materials, so count as 100% for materials)

**Conversion:**
- Completed: 9,000 × 100% = 9,000 EU
- Ending WIP: 1,000 × 60% = 600 EU
- Total Conversion EU = **9,600 EU**

**Step 2: Cost per Equivalent Unit**

**Materials:**
- Total Materials Cost = $8,000 (beginning) + $32,000 (current) = $40,000
- Cost per EU = $40,000 ÷ 10,000 = **$4 per EU**

**Conversion:**
- Total Conversion Cost = $4,000 (beginning) + $36,000 (current) = $40,000
- Cost per EU = $40,000 ÷ 9,600 = **$4.17 per EU**

**Step 3: Cost Allocation**

**Completed Units:**
- Materials: 9,000 × $4 = $36,000
- Conversion: 9,000 × $4.17 = $37,530
- **Total Completed Cost = $73,530**

**Ending WIP:**
- Materials: 1,000 × $4 = $4,000
- Conversion: 600 × $4.17 = $2,502
- **Total Ending WIP Cost = $6,502**

**Reconciliation:**
- Total Costs = $8,000 + $4,000 + $32,000 + $36,000 = $80,000
- Allocated = $73,530 + $6,502 = $80,032 (rounding difference, acceptable)

## 4. COMMON CONFUSIONS & MISTAKES

### Confusion 1: Equivalent Units for Materials
**The Mistake:** Always using percentage complete for materials equivalent units

**The Reality:**
- **Depends on when materials are added!**
- If materials added at **beginning:** All units have materials (100% complete for materials)
- If materials added at **end:** Only completed units have materials
- If materials added **evenly:** Use percentage complete

**Example:**
- 1,000 units, 60% complete
- Materials added at beginning → Materials EU = 1,000 (not 600!)
- Conversion added evenly → Conversion EU = 600

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Materials EU depends on when materials are added**
- **Always check the scenario!**

---

### Confusion 2: Weighted Average - Including Beginning WIP
**The Mistake:** Forgetting to include beginning WIP in calculations

**The Reality:**
- Weighted average **combines** beginning WIP with current period
- Beginning WIP costs are added to current costs
- Beginning WIP units are included in equivalent units

**Example:**
- Beginning WIP: 1,000 units, $5,000 cost
- Current: 9,000 units, $45,000 cost
- Total for weighted average: 10,000 units, $50,000 cost

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Weighted Average = Beginning + Current, then average**

---

### Confusion 3: Physical Units vs. Equivalent Units
**The Mistake:** Using physical units instead of equivalent units in cost calculations

**The Reality:**
- **Physical units:** Actual number of units (complete or incomplete)
- **Equivalent units:** Work done in terms of complete units
- **Cost per EU uses equivalent units, not physical units**

**Example:**
- 100 units, 50% complete
- Physical units = 100
- Equivalent units = 50
- Cost per EU = Total Cost ÷ 50 (not 100!)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Physical = Count of items**
- **Equivalent = Measure of work done**
- **Use equivalent units for cost calculations**

---

### Confusion 4: Materials Added at End
**The Mistake:** Counting ending WIP for materials when materials are added at end

**The Reality:**
- If materials added at **end of process:**
  - Only **completed units** have materials
  - Ending WIP has **zero** materials (not added yet)
  - Materials EU = Completed units only

**Example:**
- Completed: 8,000 units
- Ending WIP: 2,000 units (60% complete)
- Materials added at end
- Materials EU = 8,000 (ending WIP has no materials yet)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Materials at end = Only completed units have materials**

---

### Confusion 5: Cost Allocation Reconciliation
**The Mistake:** Not checking that costs are fully allocated

**The Reality:**
- **Total Costs Allocated must equal Total Costs Available**
- Completed Cost + Ending WIP Cost = Beginning WIP + Costs Added
- Always reconcile!

**Formula:**
- Total Available = Beginning WIP + Costs Added
- Total Allocated = Completed + Ending WIP
- These must be equal (within rounding)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Always reconcile: Available = Allocated**

---
