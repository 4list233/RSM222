## 2. CORE CONCEPTS BREAKDOWN

### Concept 1: Decentralization

**What it is:**
Organizational structure where decision-making authority is delegated to lower-level managers (segment managers, division managers).

**Why it exists:**
- Large organizations can't have all decisions made at top
- Local managers have better information
- Frees top management for strategic decisions
- Motivates managers

**What problem it solves:**
- Enables faster decisions
- Better use of local knowledge
- Develops management talent
- Improves responsiveness

**Advantages:**
- Faster decisions
- Better local information
- Develops management skills
- Motivates managers

**Disadvantages:**
- Need performance measurement systems
- May lead to suboptimal decisions (local vs. company-wide)
- Requires coordination

**Plain Language:**
- "Giving division managers authority to make decisions"
- Like a franchise - each location makes its own decisions

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Decentralization = Delegated authority**
- **Requires performance measurement**

---

### Concept 2: Segment Reporting

**What it is:**
Financial reporting that shows performance of individual segments (divisions, product lines, geographic areas).

**Why it exists:**
- Need to evaluate each segment separately
- Helps identify strong and weak segments
- Enables better resource allocation

**What problem it solves:**
- Provides segment-level performance information
- Helps evaluate segment managers
- Supports decision-making

**Key Concepts:**
- **Segment Margin:** Revenue - Variable Costs - Traceable Fixed Costs
- **Common Fixed Costs:** Costs that benefit multiple segments (not allocated for decision-making)
- **Traceable Fixed Costs:** Costs directly attributable to a segment

**Plain Language:**
- "Financial reports for each division/product line"
- Shows how each part of the business is performing

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Segment Reporting = Performance by segment**
- **Segment Margin = Segment contribution**

---

### Concept 3: Return on Investment (ROI)

**What it is:**
A performance measure that shows the rate of return on investment. Most common measure for evaluating divisions.

**Why it exists:**
- Combines profitability and investment
- Shows efficiency of asset use
- Comparable across divisions
- Widely understood

**What problem it solves:**
- Measures both profit and investment efficiency
- Enables comparison of divisions
- Provides single performance metric

**Formula:**
- **ROI = Net Operating Income ÷ Average Operating Assets**
- **ROI = Margin × Turnover**
  - Margin = Net Operating Income ÷ Sales
  - Turnover = Sales ÷ Average Operating Assets

**Interpretation:**
- Higher ROI = Better performance
- Can be improved by:
  - Increasing margin (more profit per dollar of sales)
  - Increasing turnover (more sales per dollar of assets)

**Plain Language:**
- "How much profit do we make per dollar invested?"
- Like interest rate on an investment

**Memory Anchor:**
- **ROI = Income ÷ Assets**
- **ROI = Margin × Turnover**
- **Higher is better**

---

### Concept 4: Residual Income (RI)

**What it is:**
The amount of income that exceeds the minimum required return on investment. Alternative to ROI.

**Why it exists:**
- Addresses ROI limitations
- Considers required return (cost of capital)
- Motivates investment in projects with ROI above required return
- Better for goal congruence

**What problem it solves:**
- Encourages investments that benefit company but might lower division ROI
- Considers cost of capital
- Better aligns manager and company goals

**Formula:**
- **Residual Income = Net Operating Income - (Average Operating Assets × Required Rate of Return)**
- **RI = NOI - (Assets × Required ROI)**

**Interpretation:**
- Positive RI = Earning more than required return (good)
- Negative RI = Earning less than required return (bad)
- Higher RI = Better performance

**Plain Language:**
- "How much profit exceeds the minimum required?"
- Like interest earned above the required rate

**Memory Anchor:**
- **RI = Income - (Assets × Required ROI)**
- **Positive = Good, Higher = Better**

---

### Concept 5: ROI vs. Residual Income

**What it is:**
Comparison of the two main performance measures.

**Why it matters:**
- Each has advantages and disadvantages
- Choice affects manager behavior
- Important to understand trade-offs

**ROI Advantages:**
- Widely understood
- Comparable across divisions
- Combines profit and efficiency
- Percentage form is intuitive

**ROI Disadvantages:**
- May discourage investments that benefit company but lower division ROI
- Focus on percentage, not absolute dollars
- Can lead to suboptimal decisions

**Residual Income Advantages:**
- Considers required return
- Encourages all profitable investments
- Focus on absolute dollars
- Better goal congruence

**Residual Income Disadvantages:**
- Harder to compare divisions of different sizes
- Requires setting required return
- Less intuitive than percentage

**Plain Language:**
- ROI = Percentage return (like interest rate)
- RI = Dollar amount above required (like extra profit)

**Memory Anchor:**
- **ROI = Percentage, RI = Dollars**
- **ROI may discourage good investments**
- **RI encourages all profitable investments**

---

### Concept 6: Transfer Pricing

**What it is:**
The price charged when one segment of a company provides goods or services to another segment.

**Why it exists:**
- Segments need to "sell" to each other
- Need to set internal prices
- Affects segment performance measures

**What problem it solves:**
- Determines how segments "charge" each other
- Affects segment ROI/RI
- Can motivate or discourage internal transfers

**Key Concepts:**
- **Minimum Transfer Price:** Lowest price selling division will accept
  - = Variable Cost + Opportunity Cost
- **Maximum Transfer Price:** Highest price buying division will pay
  - = External purchase price (or lower)

**Transfer Price Methods:**
1. **Market Price:** Use external market price (if available)
2. **Cost-Based:** Variable cost, full cost, or cost-plus
3. **Negotiated:** Divisions negotiate price

**Plain Language:**
- "How much does one division charge another?"
- Like internal billing between departments

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Transfer Price = Internal price between divisions**
- **Minimum = Variable Cost + Opportunity Cost**

## 3. WALK THROUGH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: ROI Calculation

**Scenario:**
- Division A:
  - Sales: $1,000,000
  - Net Operating Income: $100,000
  - Average Operating Assets: $500,000

**Questions:**
1. Calculate ROI
2. Calculate Margin and Turnover
3. Show that ROI = Margin × Turnover

**Solution:**

**Step 1: ROI**
- ROI = Net Operating Income ÷ Average Operating Assets
- ROI = $100,000 ÷ $500,000 = **0.20 or 20%**

**Step 2: Margin and Turnover**
- Margin = Net Operating Income ÷ Sales
- Margin = $100,000 ÷ $1,000,000 = **0.10 or 10%**
- Turnover = Sales ÷ Average Operating Assets
- Turnover = $1,000,000 ÷ $500,000 = **2.0**

**Step 3: Verify**
- ROI = Margin × Turnover
- 20% = 10% × 2.0 ✓

**Interpretation:**
- Division earns 20% return on assets
- Makes 10% profit margin on sales
- Turns over assets 2 times per year

---

### Example 2: Improving ROI

**Scenario:**
- Current ROI: 15%
- Current Margin: 5%
- Current Turnover: 3.0

**Questions:**
1. What would ROI be if margin increased to 6%?
2. What would ROI be if turnover increased to 3.5?
3. What would ROI be if both improved?

**Solution:**

**Current:**
- ROI = 5% × 3.0 = 15%

**If Margin Increases to 6%:**
- ROI = 6% × 3.0 = **18%**

**If Turnover Increases to 3.5:**
- ROI = 5% × 3.5 = **17.5%**

**If Both Improve:**
- ROI = 6% × 3.5 = **21%**

**Key Insight:** Improving either margin or turnover improves ROI. Improving both has multiplicative effect.

### Example 3: Residual Income Calculation

**Scenario:**
- Division B:
  - Net Operating Income: $150,000
  - Average Operating Assets: $1,000,000
  - Required Rate of Return: 12%

**Questions:**
1. Calculate Residual Income
2. Is performance acceptable?
3. What if required return was 18%?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Residual Income**
- RI = Net Operating Income - (Assets × Required ROI)
- RI = $150,000 - ($1,000,000 × 12%)
- RI = $150,000 - $120,000 = **$30,000**

**Step 2: Interpretation**
- RI is positive ($30,000) → Performance is acceptable
- Division is earning $30,000 more than required return

**Step 3: If Required Return was 18%**
- RI = $150,000 - ($1,000,000 × 18%)
- RI = $150,000 - $180,000 = **-$30,000**
- RI is negative → Performance is NOT acceptable
- Division is earning $30,000 less than required return

### Example 4: ROI vs. RI - Investment Decision

**Scenario:**
- Current Division Performance:
  - Net Operating Income: $100,000
  - Average Operating Assets: $500,000
  - Current ROI: 20%
- New Investment Opportunity:
  - Requires: $200,000 investment
  - Expected income: $35,000 per year
  - ROI of new investment: 17.5%
  - Required return: 15%

**Questions:**
1. Would manager accept if evaluated by ROI?
2. Would manager accept if evaluated by RI?
3. Which is better for the company?

**Solution:**

**If Evaluated by ROI:**
- New investment ROI: 17.5%
- Current division ROI: 20%
- **Manager would REJECT** (lowers division ROI from 20% to below 20%)

**If Evaluated by RI:**
- Current RI = $100,000 - ($500,000 × 15%) = $25,000
- New investment RI = $35,000 - ($200,000 × 15%) = $5,000
- Combined RI = $25,000 + $5,000 = $30,000
- **Manager would ACCEPT** (increases RI from $25,000 to $30,000)

**Which is Better for Company?**
- New investment ROI (17.5%) > Required return (15%)
- Investment is profitable for company
- **RI encourages acceptance (correct decision)**
- ROI discourages acceptance (suboptimal decision)

**Key Insight:** RI better aligns manager and company goals.

## 4. COMMON CONFUSIONS & MISTAKES

### Confusion 1: ROI Components
**The Mistake:** Not understanding ROI = Margin × Turnover

**The Reality:**
- ROI can be improved by:
  - Increasing margin (more profit per sale)
  - Increasing turnover (more sales per asset)
  - Both

**Memory Anchor:**
- **ROI = Margin × Turnover**
- **Improve either or both**

---

### Confusion 2: ROI vs. RI for Investment Decisions
**The Mistake:** Thinking ROI always leads to correct decisions

**The Reality:**
- ROI may discourage profitable investments (if ROI < current division ROI)
- RI encourages all investments above required return
- RI better for goal congruence

**Memory Anchor:**
- **ROI may discourage good investments**
- **RI encourages all profitable investments**

---

### Confusion 3: Residual Income Interpretation
**The Mistake:** Thinking negative RI always means division is bad

**The Reality:**
- Negative RI = Earning less than required return
- May still be acceptable depending on circumstances
- Must compare to alternatives

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Positive RI = Good**
- **Negative RI = Below required return**

---

### Confusion 4: Transfer Pricing Minimum
**The Mistake:** Using only variable cost as minimum transfer price

**The Reality:**
- Minimum = Variable Cost + Opportunity Cost
- If no external sales, opportunity cost = 0
- If can sell externally, opportunity cost = lost contribution margin

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Minimum = Variable Cost + Opportunity Cost**
- **Not just variable cost!**

---

### Confusion 5: Average Operating Assets
**The Mistake:** Using ending assets instead of average

**The Reality:**
- Should use **average** operating assets
- Average = (Beginning + Ending) ÷ 2
- More accurate for period performance

**Memory Anchor:**
- **Use average assets, not ending**
